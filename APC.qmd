# Article Processing Charges (APCs) {.unnumbered}

The *Journal of Sustainable Technology in Agriculture (JOSTA)* is committed to maintaining high standards of scholarly publishing while ensuring equitable access to authors and readers worldwide. To balance inclusivity with the practical requirements of timely publication, JOSTA adopts a **two-tier** publication system.

## Standard Publication Route (No APC) {.unnumbered}

-   **Fee**: No charges for Indian authors as well as International authors.

-   **Timeline**: Manuscripts are processed within a maximum period of one month from submission to publication, depending on the review and production schedule.

-   **Process**: Submissions follow the journal’s regular peer review workflow and are considered in the order received.

-   **Eligibility**: Available to all authors, irrespective of affiliation, funding status, or geographical location.

This route ensures that high-quality research remains freely accessible without financial barriers to authors.

## Fast Track Publication Route (APC Applicable) {.unnumbered}  

Since JOSTA offers free and open-access publication, we anticipate a high volume of submissions. To ensure a smooth and efficient review process, we provide an optional Fast-Track System that prioritizes timely evaluation and publication for eligible manuscripts.

-   **Fee**:

    -   ***₹1,500*** for Indian authors
    -   ***US\$25*** for International authors

-   **Timeline**: Decision and online publication are targeted within seven (7) calendar days of fast-track confirmation.

-   **Features**:

    -   Priority editorial and administrative handling
    -   Expedited peer review through a dedicated reviewer pool
    -   Accelerated copyediting, typesetting, and online release

-   **Conditions**:

    -   Manuscripts must pass the initial editorial screening (desk review) before being considered for fast track.
    -   A limited number of fast-track slots are available for each issue to preserve review quality and editorial oversight.
    -   The same rigorous peer review standards apply to both standard and fast track submissions.
    -   If, for reasons attributable to the journal, the fast track timeline cannot be met, the APC will be refunded in full.

## Editorial Integrity and Transparency {.unnumbered}

-   Authors must select their preferred route (standard or fast track) at the time of submission.
-   The choice of route has no bearing on editorial decisions, which remain solely grounded in the scholarly merit, originality, and relevance of the manuscript.
-   APCs cover only the cost of accelerated processing; they do not influence acceptance outcomes.
-   Waivers or partial reductions in fast track APCs may be considered, upon request, for early-career researchers or authors from under developed countries.

## Commitment to Ethical Publishing {.unnumbered}

JOSTA reaffirms its commitment to maintaining fairness, transparency, and academic rigor across all stages of the publication process. Both routes—standard and fast track—adhere to the same principles of double-blind peer review, editorial independence, and international ethical standards in scholarly publishing.
