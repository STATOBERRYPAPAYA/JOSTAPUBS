<p>In recent decades, livelihood security had emerged as a critical focus area in development studies, emphasizing the need to ensure sustainable living conditions for both present and future generations. The concept of Sustainable Livelihood Security (SLS) represents a holistic approach that integrates current challenges and policy priorities in sustainable development <span class="citation" data-cites="Singh2010">(Singh and Hiremath 2010)</span> and has been increasingly applied in policy analysis frameworks to connect poverty reduction with resilience strategies <span class="citation" data-cites="Pani2022">(Pani and Mishra 2022)</span>. SLS builds on the three pillars of sustainability: environmental preservation, economic growth, and social equity. It focuses on the interconnections necessary to achieve sustainable results <span class="citation" data-cites="Morse2013">(Morse and McNamara 2013)</span>. Livelihood security, as first conceptualized by Chambers and Conway, integrates capabilities, equity, and sustainability <span class="citation" data-cites="Chambers1992">(Chambers and Conway 1992)</span>. Livelihoods refer to the means of earning a living, influenced by factors such as birth, inheritance, and social roles, as well as broader social, economic, and environmental conditions. Equity ensures fair access to resources, while sustainability focuses on preserving these resources for future generations. Recent research also stresses the role of livelihood diversification, adaptive capacity, and social networks in reducing vulnerability to risks <span class="citation" data-cites="BeltranTolosa2022 Barnes2025">(Beltrán-Tolosa et al. 2022; Barnes et al. 2025)</span>.</p>
<p>In rural contexts, livelihoods often encompass a mix of on-farm and off-farm activities that help households secure food and income. However, various internal and external factors such as limited income, inadequate mobility strategies, and resource constraints frequently disrupt livelihood security, particularly for livestock-dependent households <span class="citation" data-cites="Martin2016">(Martin et al. 2016)</span>. Key determinants of rural livelihood security include age, farming experience, social participation, income levels, and livestock ownership. To address these challenges, interventions such as farm diversification, the adoption of Good Agricultural Practices (GAP), and empowering rural women to engage in value-addition activities had been suggested <span class="citation" data-cites="Mishra2023">(Mishra et al. 2023)</span>. Moreover, livelihoods depend on the availability of household resources and their integration into legal, political, and social systems <span class="citation" data-cites="Narayani2011">(Narayani et al. 2011)</span>.</p>
<p>Global crises such as climate change, armed conflicts, displacement, pandemics, and digital inequality further exacerbate the challenges to livelihood security, particularly in vulnerable regions. These crises not only hinder progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) but also deepen food and nutrition insecurity for millions worldwide <span class="citation" data-cites="UNDP2022">(United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) 2022)</span>. Addressing this issue requires innovative strategies to enhance food and nutrition security, particularly for smallholder farmers in developing countries. Studies highlighted the importance of prioritizing off-farm and non-farm livelihood diversification rather than attempting all options simultaneously <span class="citation" data-cites="Haile2024">(Haile et al. 2024)</span>. Additionally, traditional farming systems like home gardens, which depend on household assets, play a crucial role in ensuring food security and conserving biodiversity <span class="citation" data-cites="George2024">(George et al. 2024)</span>. However, rural areas, particularly in India, continue to face a mix of sustainable and unsustainable farming practices, impacting productivity and resilience <span class="citation" data-cites="Abed2025">(Abed et al. 2025)</span>.</p>
<p>In recent years, livelihood security has attracted growing scholarly and policy attention due to challenges such as climate change, globalization, and persistent socio-economic inequalities. To understand the evolving dynamics of livelihood security, bibliometric analysis serves as a powerful tool. Recognized as a scientific discipline, bibliometric analysis systematically evaluates research trends, patterns, and knowledge gaps in specific domains <span class="citation" data-cites="Ellegaard2015">(Ellegaard and Wallin 2015)</span>. By analyzing scholarly outputs, citation networks, and thematic clusters, bibliometric studies offer critical insights into the evolution of research fields, key contributors, and policy implications. With user-friendly, menu-driven tools for assessing research performance and tracking institutional progress, bibliometric methods have become reliable and informative instruments <span class="citation" data-cites="Kumar2023 Donthu2021">(Kumar, George, and PS 2023; Donthu et al. 2021)</span>. This study aims to conduct a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of livelihood security, identifying core themes, emerging trends, and existing research gaps. Leveraging advanced bibliometric tools, this paper seeks to provide a roadmap for academics, policymakers, and practitioners striving to enhance livelihood security across diverse contexts. This study utilizes the scopus database to analyze and summarize publications related to livelihood security.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>The annual citation pattern of livelihood security publications from 2014 to 2024 is shown in Figure&nbsp;2. The trend indicates considerable fluctuations during the period. In the early years (2014–2015), the average citation rate was in between 4 and 5 citations per article. From 2016 to 2020, the average remained steady in between 2 and 3 citations, reflecting moderate academic attention. A sharp increase was observed in 2021, when the citation rate exceeded 6 citations per article, representing the peak of scholarly influence. This surge suggests that research published around this period received strong recognition, possibly linked to heightened global debates on livelihood resilience, food security, and climate change during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, after 2021, the trend declined steeply, falling to in between 1 and 2 citations in 2022 and dropping close to 1 citation per article by 2024. A probable reason for this may be that newly published articles require time to accumulate citations. Since publications increased significantly during 2022–2024, most of these recent papers have not yet had sufficient time to be cited. Citations generally peak 2–4 years after publication, so the observed decline reflects a natural citation lag rather than reduced academic relevance.</p>

<p>This study is primarily limited to publications indexed in the Scopus database, specifically within the fields of economics, finance, and econometrics, thereby excluding other databases such as Web of Science or various regional repositories. Additionally, the focus on English-language articles means that valuable research published in other languages may be omitted. Moreover, the selected timeframe of 2014–2024 restricts the analysis, potentially overlooking earlier foundational work as well as very recent emerging trends. Furthermore, only articles have been considered as the document type for this analysis, excluding other forms of scholarly publications such as reviews, conference papers, or book chapters.</p>

<h2 data-number="6" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion"><span class="header-section-number">6</span> Conclusion</h2>
<p>The analysis showed that livelihood security research expanded steadily over the past decade, with publications rising sharply after 2016 and peaking in 2024, although citation rates fluctuated and reached their highest point in 2021 before declining in subsequent years. Marine Policy, Environment, Development and Sustainability, and World Development emerged as the leading journals, while authors such as Belton B, Balasubramanya S, and Bennett N J were among the most prolific contributors. Key institutions, including Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, the University for Development Studies, and Michigan State University, played major roles in shaping the research landscape. The USA recorded the highest number of citations, followed by India and Canada, indicating strong contributions from multiple regions. Collaboration networks further revealed the USA as a major global hub with strong links to India, Germany, and Australia, while India and China also demonstrated extensive international partnerships. Keyword analysis identified “food security,” “livelihood,” “climate change,” and “sustainability” as dominant themes, along with related concepts such as rural development, gender, adaptive management, fisheries, and smallholder farming, reflecting the interdisciplinary and global nature of livelihood security research. Overall, the bibliometric analysis of 514 Scopus-indexed articles published between 2014 and 2024 highlighted emerging research fronts and provided valuable insights for scholars and policymakers, emphasizing the need for strengthened international collaboration, targeted interventions, and sustainable practices to enhance livelihood resilience and support sustainable development.</p>

<p>Amidst the growing population, including urbanisation as well as industrialisation has now diminishes the growing agricultural land fields. This abrupt change had affected by demand of food and supply ratio, but still the growing population should satisfy the food for their daily needs <span class="citation" data-cites="Tilman2011">(Tilman et al. 2011)</span>. However, the conventional agriculture is facing reduction in production and increased in cost of input. In addition, loss of agriculture productivity due to natural and anthropogenic activity leads that land degradation and reduced crop yield. Land use pattern shift varies frequently due to modernization and urbanization, hence reduces arable land. Farmers are also leaving this practice because of low-cost benefits and introduction of different variety of seed and technology. As the population continues to grow rapidly, the demand for agricultural land to cultivate crops is becoming increasingly important. For generating every single piece of crop, soil is the wholesome medium thorough which we can able to grow. To produce any crop, soil serves as the fundamental and indispensable medium for plant growth. To make soil alive or fertile, one must shall focus on corresponding way of making it naturally to Sustainable natural practices. The other part of organic farming is being not practices every corner which allows farmers to use intensive inorganic fertilizers, pesticide ultimately degrading soil systems <span class="citation" data-cites="VG2024">(V. G. et al. 2024)</span>.</p>
<p>Also agriculture shifts in production and led to insecurity in food production because of climate change, anthropogenic activities, natural resource scavenging and ultimately leads to poor soil health. Continuing traditional practices like heavy application of pesticide and inorganic fertilizers had made soil productivity less and thus making soil organism less motile and active <span class="citation" data-cites="Bhattacharyya2012">(Bhattacharyya and Jha 2012)</span>. Plants interact with microorganisms in various ways such as positive, negative and neutral. It has been observed that the whole plant, root and shoot system including different organs like buds, flowers, fruits and seeds harbour many kinds of microorganisms inner (endophytes) and outer (epiphytes) surface of the plant and it encompasses various relation like competition, exploitation, neutrality, commensalism, and mutualism <span class="citation" data-cites="Barea2015 Jacoby2017">(Barea 2015; Jacoby et al. 2017)</span>. This review paper shall strongly focuses on importance of soil micro biome population in soil rhizosphere region and harnessing its critical role in promoting sustainable agriculture and crop resilient systems.</p>

<p>Soil microorganisms were the key players in the soil system. They are often called as “Bio-engineer”. The presence of a diverse soil microbial community is crucial to the productivity of any ecosystem, since microorganisms affect all levels within the ecosystem. While potential harmful effects from soil microorganisms include plant diseases, production of plant-suppressive compounds, and loss of plant-available nutrients <span class="citation" data-cites="BrueW1987">(BrueW 1987)</span>, the majority of soil microorganisms are beneficial to plant growth <span class="citation" data-cites="Vessey2003">(Vessey 2003)</span>. Harmful microorganisms suppress plant hormones primarily by producing excessive amounts of naturally occurring hormones, which disrupt the plant’s delicate hormonal balance, or by producing phytotoxic metabolites that inhibit growth, for example, <em>Agrobacterium spp.</em> induces tumor or gall formation by causing an imbalance in auxin and cytokinin levels <span class="citation" data-cites="Koza2022">(Koza et al. 2022)</span>.</p>
<p>The rhizosphere is a thin layer of soil that surrounds plant roots and is a central place for microbial activity. It’s made up of soil particles, organic matter, plant roots, and a diverse community of microbes. The rhizosphere is a micro ecosystem where complex interactions take place between the plant roots and the microorganisms.</p>
<p>Soil micro-biome community were significant contributor of our living eco-system which aid in servicing life on our planet, regulating carbon cycle, and other multifaceted nutrient transformation. But ongoing global climate change crisis, the abundant organisms in soil were prone to deteriorating in non-linear manner and thus circumstances paved way for soil degradation and poor land management scenarios <span class="citation" data-cites="Amundson2015">(Amundson et al. 2015)</span>. Also increased land site prone for industrial deployment, mining site and alloy factories development in recent time causes soil to be getting polluted and prone for heavy-metal contamination <span class="citation" data-cites="Koushal2025">(Koushal et al. 2025)</span>. Hence it subdues the critical utilisation of biological micro-organism rendering in boosting crop growth, development and food security. The functional aspects of microbial dynamics in soil function is given in Figure&nbsp;1.</p>

<p>Microbial inoculants application increase biodiversity, creating suitable condition for development of beneficial microorganism. They also improve physical properties of soil such as; improve structure and aggregation of soil particles; reduce soil compaction, increase pore spaces and water infiltration <span class="citation" data-cites="Carvajal2012">(Carvajal-Muñoz and Carmona-Garcia 2012)</span>. The basic buildings blocks of soil are mineral soil particles that are classified based on their sizes into clay (&lt;2 <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%CE%BCm">), silt (2-63 <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%CE%BCm">) and sand (63-2,000 <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%CE%BCm">) <span class="citation" data-cites="Blott2012">(Blott and Pye 2012)</span>. Most soil microorganisms live as interconnected assemblages associated with these particles, so that the soil structure ultimately determines their resources through oxygen diffusion, water flow, organic matter accessibility and nutrient availability <span class="citation" data-cites="Wilpiszeski2019">(Wilpiszeski et al. 2019)</span>.

<p>Soil chemical properties are strongly associated with soil microorganisms. Soil microorganisms are primarily responsible for many critical processes associated with biogeochemical cycles, as well as the transformation and breakdown of soil components. They also play significant roles in the soil ecosystem <span class="citation" data-cites="DAcunto2018">(D’Acunto et al. 2018)</span>. Although pH of the soil has been reduced when soil with good source of microorganisms. Since, they excrete organic acids when decomposing organic matter like phenolic, carboxylic acid, they will constantly reduce the state of pH of the soil. Each organism surveillance in soil depends on soil pH, as fungi prefers acidic range <span class="citation" data-cites="Ali2017">(Ali, Fradi, and Al-araji 2017)</span>, temperature of about 30-50℃ <span class="citation" data-cites="Zhang2016">(Zhang et al. 2016)</span> and it contributes more to N2O emissions than bacteria in acidic soil <span class="citation" data-cites="Yin2023">(Yin et al. 2023)</span>. In the same way, bacterial population opts neutral soil reaction (6.0-7.0) <span class="citation" data-cites="Wang2019">(Wang et al. 2019)</span> and actinobacteria rely alkaline condition <span class="citation" data-cites="Araujo2020">(Araujo et al. 2020)</span>.</p>

<p>In general soil biology, enzyme assays have been established to a set of enzymes linked to high-functioning soil microbiota, such as protease, urease, various phosphatases, and sulfatase. Organisms, both animals (fauna / micro-fauna) and plants (flora / micro-flora) are important in the overall quality, fertility and stability of soil. These microorganisms are responsible for the formation of humus, a product of organic matter degradation and synthesis. Moreover, organisms helps in myriad of biochemical reactions and intricate biological processes that takes place. Fractionation of soil organic matter like humic acid, fulvic acid, hematomelanic acid and humin substances were secreted by microorganisms in the soil system and it aids in other biochemical reaction over soil. Addition of bio char (pyrolysis product) amendment improves soil properties and store long term carbon storage in soil and enhances microbial diversity and function in soil <span class="citation" data-cites="Gangadaran2024a">(Gangadaran et al. 2024)</span>.</p>

<p>Microbial biomass carbon is a measure of the carbon contained within the living component of soil organic matter (<em>i.e.</em> bacteria and fungi). Microbes decompose soil organic matter which in turn releasing carbon dioxide and plant available nutrients. Farming systems that maximise organic matter return to soil and minimise soil disturbance tend to increase the microbial biomass. Soil properties such as pH, clay, and the availability of organic carbon all influence the size of the microbial biomass. Microbial biomass is also an early indicator of changes in total organic C. Unlike total organic C, microbial biomass C responds quickly to management changes. The interaction between plants and their surroundings is a dynamic process in which plants monitor their environment and react to changes. The root system, which was traditionally thought to only provide anchorage and uptake of nutrients and water, is a key element to a plant interacting with its surroundings <span class="citation" data-cites="Bais2006">(Bais et al. 2006)</span>. Chemical signals emitted by soil microorganisms are received and recognized by plants and then addressed through the release of chemical compounds in the form of root exudates. Secretion of these compounds varies between different plant species <span class="citation" data-cites="Rovira1969">(Rovira 1969)</span>, ecotypes <span class="citation" data-cites="Micallef2009">(Micallef, Shiaris, and Colón-Carmona 2009)</span>, and even distinct roots growth within a plant <span class="citation" data-cites="Uren2007">(Uren 2007)</span>.</p>

<p>Earth crust is an important component for earth’s biosphere reserves. Every living entity forms an encircled environment through which they fulfil their life style. It was estimated that one gram of soil contains up to ten billion bacterial cells. Decline in soil fertility is major concern for food security. Soil microbes contribute to a wide range of function in controlling soil health and crop productivity <span class="citation" data-cites="Sahoo2015">(Sahoo et al. 2015)</span>. Soil microbes helps in maintaining the soil properties in both direct and indirect methods. Plant–microbe interaction is one of the important aspects for agriculture system. This association may help to achieve goal of future sustainable agriculture. Microorganism is fundamental component of soil for all nutrient cycles and plant nutrient. Variation in temperature, low water content, anthropogenic, and grazing causes detrimental impact on microbial diversity and soil process. Soil - root - microbes form a comparatively stable and beneficial association. Some microbes have negative impact also in rhizosphere zone and harmful for plant growth and development <span class="citation" data-cites="Ahmad2008">(Ahmad, Ahmad, and Khan 2008)</span>. Due to intensive cropping and unhealthy effect of fertilizers, this relation declines soil microbial diversity. There are some microbial plant growth promoting substance which was released by the microbes and their role in plant growth and development which was tabulated in Table&nbsp;1.</p>

<p>Bio-fertilizer are an important component of integrated nutrients management. Microorganisms that are used as bio-fertilizer components include; nitrogen fixers (N-fixer) (<em>Rhizobium, Azotobacter</em>), potassium and phosphorus solubilizers (<em>Bacillus megaterium</em>, <em>Pseudomonas fluorescens</em>, <em>Aspergillus spp.</em>, <em>Penicillium spp.</em>, <em>Trichoderma spp.</em>, and <em>Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans</em>), growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPRs) (<em>Pseudomonas, Azospirillum, Azotobacter, Bacillus</em>), endo (<em>Glomus intraradices</em>) and ecto mycorrhizal fungi (<em>Amanita, Boletus, and Laccaria</em>), cyanobacteria and other useful microscopic organisms. The use of bio-fertilizers leads to improved nutrients, water uptake, plant growth and plant tolerance to abiotic and biotic factors. The different mechanisms of action of biofertilizers, including nutrient uptake facilitation, phytohormone regulation, and phytoprotection, must be understood to effectively utilize their potential for increasing the ecological services of forest biomes and promoting production in agriculture sectors <span class="citation" data-cites="Liu2021">(Liu and Poobathy 2021)</span>. Bio-fertilizer is a substance which contains living microorganisms which when applied to the soil; a seed or plant surface colonizes the rhizosphere <span class="citation" data-cites="Gangadaran2024a">(Gangadaran et al. 2024)</span> and promotes growth by increasing the supply or availability of nutrients to the host plant and containing living cells of different of micro-organisms which have ability to convert nutritionally important elements from unavailable to available form through biological processes <span class="citation" data-cites="Vessey2003">(Vessey 2003)</span>. This biological fertilizers would play a key role in productivity and sustainability of soil and also in protecting the environment as eco-friendly and cost effective inputs for the small holder farmers. Adding of the nutrients through the natural processes of nitrogen fixation, solubilizing phosphorus, and stimulating plant growth through the synthesis of growth-promoting substances are a good way to sustain our agricultural systems. Soil management strategies today are mainly dependent on inorganic chemical-based fertilizers, which cause a serious threat to human health and the environment <span class="citation" data-cites="Ritika2014">(Ritika and Uptal 2014)</span>.</p>

<p>Soil microbial communities are highly diverse, comprising a quarter of Earth’s total biodiversity, and are among the most abundant and diverse organisms on the planet. Soil plays a crucial role in biogeochemical cycles. Soil microbial diversity also plays a key role in maintaining EMF, facilitating material cycling and energy flow between aboveground and belowground communities through processes such as litter decomposition and organic matter mineralization. In agricultural ecosystems, soil microbial diversity shows a significant positive correlation with EMF. Based on early experiments, found that the functional complexity of soil communities enhances EMF indices derived from multiple methods. Research confirms that soil microbes are directly involved in complex physicochemical processes related to soil nutrients, thus influencing soil EF (Ecosystem Function) and EMF (Ecosystem Multifunctionality). While aboveground biodiversity has received more attention in BEMF(Biodiversity and Ecosystem Multifunctionality) research, studies on the impact of belowground biodiversity on overall EMF have lagged. Soil microbial diversity profoundly affects plant nutrient uptake and nutrient cycling between aboveground and belowground biological communities. Therefore, understanding the impact of belowground biodiversity on EF and EMF is of paramount importance.</p>

<p>Soil microorganisms play an important role in the decomposition and circulation of organic matter, nutrients or xenobiotic. They are responsible for plant health and nutrition and have an impact on the structure and fertility of the soil <span class="citation" data-cites="Wolejko2020">(Wołejko et al. 2020)</span>. Soil metagenomics is a cultivation-independent molecular approach to explore and exploit the enormous diversity of soil microbial communities. This technology comprises isolation of soil DNA and production and screening of clone libraries. Screening of metagenomic soil libraries, especially by activity-based approaches, has led to the identification of various novel biomolecules, including enzymes and antibiotics of industrial importance <span class="citation" data-cites="Daniel2005">(Daniel 2005)</span>. Also, other method for quantifying the soil microbiome is profiling. The method of analysing soil microbial community composition and function is known as SM analysis. Since scientists have realised how important microorganisms are to the production and health of soil, this method has grown in popularity. This is a step-by-step instruction explaining our methodology for microbiome analysis <span class="citation" data-cites="Nalage2022 Wydro2022">(Nalage et al. 2022; Wydro 2022)</span>. It involves Sample collection, DNA extraction, sequencing and finally data interpretation. Thus, it aids in strain based bio-formulation preparation on crop specific target which facilitates better use of microbial activity in soil. Usually the character of any species or human or animal were determined by their DNA. Thus extraction of DNA will prone for species identification. Fig. 6. Explains different soil DNA extraction procedure.</p>

<h2 data-number="2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Conclusion</h2>
<p>Soil forms the foundation of agricultural production and national food security; therefore, maintaining a healthy and fertile soil environment is essential for diversified cropping systems and long-term sustainability. This review highlights the critical role of the soil microbiome in regulating soil processes and demonstrates how biofertilizers contribute to improved soil fertility and crop productivity. Biofertilizers enhance plant growth through biological nitrogen fixation, solubilization of insoluble phosphates, synthesis of phytohormones, vitamins, and other growth-promoting substances, along with mobilization of nutrients and suppression of soil-borne pathogens. They also facilitate disease control, nutrient recycling, and promote a balanced soil ecosystem. Recent advancements in soil microbiome research have clarified the complex interactions among microbes, soil health, and ecosystem functioning, underscoring their importance in sustainable agriculture. Incorporating well-decomposed organic manures such as FYM, compost, and goat manure can further enrich the soil, support diverse microbial communities, and enhance ecological resilience. Overall, while the subject carries substantial relevance and potential benefits for agriculture, continued scientific refinement and systematic evaluation are essential to fully realize and apply these concepts effectively.</p>

<p>Career expectations play a critical role in shaping the professional pathways of agricultural graduates, yet these expectations differ substantially among key stakeholders, including students, educators, industry employers, and extension officers. Although the agricultural sector is widely perceived as offering strong career prospects-driven by global challenges such as food security, climate change, and the push for sustainable agricultural practices, there is often a measurable gap between these optimistic views and actual industry experiences. This misalignment can result in professional dissatisfaction, skills job mismatches, and reduced retention in the sector <span class="citation" data-cites="scasta2018employer ganiev2018career zinnah2001assessment">(Scasta 2018; Ganiev, Sanaev, and Pardaev 2018; Zinnah et al. 2001)</span>. Despite an increasing global demand for skilled agricultural professionals, many graduates continue to experience uncertainty in their career progression due to unclear advancement trajectories and limited visibility of growth opportunities within the sector and high competitions <span class="citation" data-cites="black2025social hassen2025taking">(Black et al. 2025; Hassen et al. 2025)</span>. These concerns are further amplified by work-life balance challenges, including extended working hours, seasonal workload peaks, and expectations of availability beyond regular schedules. Such conditions create a paradox wherein the sector presents significant opportunities but simultaneously imposes structural constraints that may undermine long-term career satisfaction and workforce stability <span class="citation" data-cites="mabaso2023employer adedapo2014determinants">(Mabaso and Monyane 2023; Adedapo et al. 2014)</span>. The importance of examining stakeholders’ career expectation variances lies in the discrete perspectives each group brings to the agricultural profession. While students focus on educational quality and employment prospects, educators emphasise curriculum relevance and skill development, employers prioritise practical competencies and productivity, and extension officers consider field realities and community engagement <span class="citation" data-cites="raju2023study sadovska2025engagement">(Raju and Devarani 2023; Sadovska et al. 2025)</span>. Understanding this diversity of views helps identify key gaps and areas of convergence, offering a basis for targeted policy and institutional reforms.</p>
<p>Exploring stakeholders’ semantic perceptions is essential because students, educators, employers, and extension officers each frame agricultural careers through different experiential and institutional lenses. These perceptual differences influence how key dimensions such as job security, career advancement, competency relevance, and work-life balance are understood across the sector. Semantic differential analysis makes it possible to systematically capture these evaluative variations, revealing where expectations converge or diverge. Such evidence is critical for policy reform, as it identifies misalignments between graduate preparation and sectoral realities and highlights areas where curricula, skill development, and workforce strategies require adjustment. Based on this rationale, the study was conducted to examine the stakeholder perceptions to generate actionable insights for strengthening agri-graduates career readiness and aligning policy with contemporary agricultural workforce needs.</p>

<section id="methodology" class="level2" data-number="2">
<h2 data-number="2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="methodology"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Methodology</h2>
<p>This study used a descriptive, quantitative research design to examine variations in career expectations among key stakeholder groups within the agricultural sector. The survey included 40 respondents selected through simple random sampling, such as Assistant Directors of Agriculture, Agricultural Officers, Bank Sector Employers, Private Sector Employers, and Faculty Members. The investigation was part of a larger research project on agricultural students’ career orientations, with stakeholder perceptions incorporated to provide a system-wide understanding of how career conditions are viewed across the agricultural hierarchy. Since stakeholders influence policy decisions, training programs, hiring practices, and workplace norms, assessing their perceptions is crucial for identifying gaps between educational preparation and workforce realities using semantic differentials.</p>
<p>A structured questionnaire using a 7-point semantic differential scale was administered to capture nuanced stakeholder perceptions across four core career dimensions: job market accessibility, career advancement opportunities, job security, and work–life balance. Uniform bipolar adjective pairs (e.g., Secure-Insecure, Clear Path-Unclear Path, Balanced-Stressful) were applied across all stakeholder categories to ensure comparability. Content validity was established through expert review in agricultural extension, human resource development, and rural management. The resulting data were analysed using descriptive statistics, including means, standard deviations, and response ranges. Higher mean scores (above 5.5) were interpreted as indicating an optimistic perception, whereas lower scores (below 3.5) signalled apprehension or concern, enabling systematic identification of positive and negative evaluative trends. These statistical patterns revealed both convergence and divergence in stakeholder attitudes, providing an evidence base for policy adjustments and curriculum refinements aimed at strengthening agricultural career preparedness.</p>

<section id="results" class="level2" data-number="3">
<h2 data-number="3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="results"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Results</h2>
<p>The analysis of career expectations among agricultural sector stakeholders reveals generally positive perceptions regarding several key aspects of the profession. The job market was viewed favourably (M = 6.01, 83.4%), with stakeholders indicating that they perceive the agricultural job market as highly accessible. Similarly, the demand for the profession (M = 5.82, 80.4%) and opportunities for skill enhancement (M = 5.82, 80.4%) were also seen in a positive light, reflecting confidence in the growing relevance of agricultural graduates and the abundant opportunities for professional growth. Job security (M = 5.53, 75.6%) and career success determination (M = 5.57, 76.2%) were similarly rated favourably, signaling that stakeholders view agricultural careers as offering stability and a balanced pathway to success.</p>

<p>However, the analysis also highlighted concerns related to career progression and work-life balance. The perception of career progression was more mixed (M = 3.53, 42.1%), with respondents expressing uncertainty about the clarity and predictability of growth opportunities in the sector. Moreover, there were consistent concerns about work-life quality. Work schedule (M = 2.91, 31.8%) and personal time for family/leisure (M = 2.91, 31.8%) were rated lower, suggesting that agricultural professionals face challenges in balancing work and personal time. Issues with work-life balance (M = 3.35, 39.1%) and availability expectations (M = 2.42, 23.6%) further underscored the high demands placed on professionals in the field, with limited flexibility to manage personal and professional commitments.</p>

<h2 data-number="4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="discussion"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Discussion</h2>
<p>The findings of this study reveal a dual perspective among stakeholders in the agricultural sector. On the positive side, stakeholders’ express optimism about the job market, demand for the profession, and opportunities for skill enhancement, all of which indicate a favourable outlook on agricultural careers. These results align with existing research highlighting an increasing global demand for skilled professionals in agriculture, driven by critical issues such as food security, climate change, and the shift toward sustainable farming practices <span class="citation" data-cites="hassen2025taking santhanam2024elaborating">(Hassen et al. 2025; Santhanam-Martin et al. 2024)</span>. The agricultural sector is undergoing transformative changes that require a skilled and adaptive workforce capable of addressing these challenges <span class="citation" data-cites="dedieu2022perspectives">(Dedieu et al. 2022)</span>. Moreover, the positive views on job security and career success found in this study echo broader findings suggesting that agriculture remains a stable career choice with promising long-term prospects, which enhances its appeal among younger professionals seeking secure and impactful career pathways <span class="citation" data-cites="scasta2018employer bhurke2018agriculture">(Scasta 2018; Bhurke and Patil 2018)</span>.</p>
<p>On the flip side, concerns regarding career progression and work-life balance present significant challenges. The career progression aspect was perceived as unpredictable (M = 3.53), mirroring earlier studies that have highlighted a lack of clear career paths and growth opportunities within the agricultural sector <span class="citation" data-cites="zulaikha2021perceptions">(Zulaikha, Martono, and Himam 2021)</span>. This uncertainty around career growth can hinder the professional development of agricultural graduates and may discourage them from pursuing long-term careers in the field <span class="citation" data-cites="manyasi2023trends wilkes2019decade">(Manyasi et al. 2023; Wilkes and Burns 2019)</span>.</p>
<p>Moreover, the concerns around work-life balance were particularly notable, with respondents expressing dissatisfaction with work schedules, personal time for family and leisure, and availability expectations <span class="citation" data-cites="suryaja2019work guest2002perspectives tijani2013perception">(Suryaja and Thomas 2019; Guest 2002; Tijani and Omirin 2013)</span>. These low ratings suggest that agricultural professionals are often faced with demanding work conditions, which limit their ability to manage personal time and professional responsibilities effectively. These finding echoes research showing the growing significance of work-life balance in career satisfaction, especially in industries like agriculture, where irregular hours and seasonal pressures are common <span class="citation" data-cites="adisa2024agricultural kong2015meeting">(Adisa et al. 2024; Kong, Wang, and Fu 2015)</span>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the study underscores the need to address the concerns around work-life integration within the agricultural sector. While the sector is perceived positively in terms of career opportunities and job security, the lack of clear career progression and the strain on work-life balance may deter young professionals from committing to long-term careers in agriculture. As the sector continues to evolve, it is crucial for policymakers and institutions to focus on creating transparent career pathways, introducing work-life balance reforms, and fostering environments that support both professional development and personal well-being.</p>

<section id="conclusion" class="level2" data-number="5">
<h2 data-number="5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion"><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Conclusion</h2>
<p>The study demonstrates that stakeholders hold generally positive views regarding employment opportunities, job security, and skill development in the agricultural sector; however, concerns persist about unclear career advancement pathways and difficulties in maintaining work–life balance and even cases of job quitting and job hopping. These findings indicate perceptual gaps that, if unaddressed, may affect long-term satisfaction and retention. From a policy perspective, the results underscore the need for clearer, competency-linked career progression systems and measures that mitigate workload pressures, especially during seasonal peaks. Institutions can support this by aligning training with sectoral demands, strengthening career guidance, and improving transparency around growth opportunities. Ensuring structured advancement routes and reasonable work expectations can enhance both workforce stability and sectoral attractiveness.</p>

Across India, generations of farmers have practiced indigenous farming methods that preserve soil fertility, enhance crop diversity and reduce reliance on synthetic inputs, embodying principles of ecological balance and traditional knowledge long before the term “Agroecology” was formally recognized <span class="citation" data-cites="nicholls2018pathways bisht2022agroecological">(Nicholls and Altieri 2018; Bisht et al. 2022)</span>.</p>
<p>Among the states in India, the Northeast region is well renowned for its rich agricultural diversity, deep-rooted cultural heritage and indigenous traditional knowledge systems <span class="citation" data-cites="singh2024review Pandey2024meitei">(Singh 2024; Pandey, Brearley, and Ram 2024)</span>. Meghalaya, in particular, stands out due to its unique agroecological landscape, where traditional farming practices such as shifting cultivation (jhum), terrace (bun) farming and agroforestry are extensively practiced by indigenous communities <span class="citation" data-cites="tiwari2018shifting borah2018managing tynsong2020traditional">(Tiwari and Pant 2018; J. Borah 2018; Tynsong 2020)</span>. These practices are integrated with local environmental conditions, promoting biodiversity conservation, soil fertility and climate resilience. Therefore, Meghalaya’s farming traditions exemplify a harmonious relationship between people and nature, making it a pivotal region for agroecological research and sustainable agricultural development. This strong cultural and ecological foundation positions Meghalaya as a “critical hub” for advancing agroecology in Northeast India and beyond.</p>
<p>However, in the past few years, evolving socio-economic pressures, population growth and increased market integration have significantly transformed traditional agricultural systems in Meghalaya. The intensification and commercialization of farming have gradually displaced long-standing agroecological practices <span class="citation" data-cites="krishna2020agriculture behera2023commercialization">(Krishna 2020; Behera, Rout, and Paul 2023)</span>. As farmers adapt to new economic realities, many indigenous methods rooted in traditional knowledge are being modified or replaced by input-intensive and market-driven approaches. This transition highlights the urgent need to critically examine the current patterns, scope and determinants of agroecological adoption, to better understand how farming communities balance livelihood enhancement with environmental sustainability <span class="citation" data-cites="giri2020traditional tyngkan2022determinants">(Giri et al. 2020; Tyngkan et al. 2022)</span>.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Meghalaya’s strong base of indigenous knowledge and traditional ecological practices, coupled with a growing interest in sustainable agriculture, presents significant potential for advancing agroecological transformation in the region <span class="citation" data-cites="borah2024traditional">(D. Borah, Rout, and Nooruddin 2024)</span>. Although Meghalaya’s traditional farming systems are well documented, there is limited empirical research examining how farmers understand and adopt agroecological principles in the context of today’s rapidly changing socio-economic environment. Most existing studies concentrate on specific indigenous practices rather than comprehensively exploring socio-economic determinants or evaluating farms through a multidimensional agroecology framework. Key constraints, including market pressures, livelihood transitions, and the erosion of traditional knowledge, remain insufficiently investigated.</p>

<p>Multistage sampling technique was employed to select primary sampling units. The study was conducted in South West Garo Hills District of Meghalaya. Selsella Block was purposively chosen due to its high concentration of farmers practicing organic farming, agroforestry and other sustainable agriculture systems, based on the records with the Block Agriculture Office (BAO). Within this block, Harigaon and Sankarigre villages were selected as representative sites owing to their notable progress in integrated farming systems, organic farming practices and sustainable farming initiatives. A sampling frame was prepared for each village and 40 farmers (20 from Harigaon and 20 from Sankarigre) were selected through simple random sampling. The study area was purposively chosen to represent regions where traditional and sustainable farming systems coexist, enabling assessment of both the potential and the gaps in agroecological adoption.</p>
<p>Data were collected using the KoboToolbox platform through semi-structured, pre-tested interview schedule, field observations and participatory discussions with farmers. KoboToolbox facilitated efficient digital data capture on mobile devices, supporting offline data entry, conditional question logic and real-time synchronization, thereby ensuring accuracy and ease of data management for the study. The assessment of agroecological performance utilized the Food and Agriculture Organization’s (FAO) Tool for Agroecology Performance Evaluation “TAPE” <span class="citation" data-cites="fao2019tape">(FAO [Food and Agriculture Organization] 2019)</span>. This comprehensive tool evaluates farm performance across ten key dimensions of agroecology: Diversity, Synergy, Efficiency, Recycling, Resilience, Co-creation and Sharing of Knowledge, Human and Social Values, Culture and Food Traditions, Responsible Governance and Circular and Solidarity Economy. ‘TAPE’ provides a holistic framework to measure and guide the transition toward sustainable agroecological systems by capturing environmental, social and economic aspects at the farm level <span class="citation" data-cites="Mottet2020assessing gharbi2025assessment">(Mottet et al. 2020; Gharbi et al. 2025)</span>.</p>
<p>An (AAI) was developed to quantify the extent to which farmers practiced agroecological principles within their farming systems. The index was constructed using data obtained through content analysis of farmer interviews, field observations and participatory assessments. Each farmer’s practices were evaluated across the ten dimensions of agroecology defined by the ‘TAPE’.</p>
<p>For each dimension, a set of thematic indicators and sub-codes were identified to represent the corresponding agroecological attributes. The frequency and intensity of these codes across farms were used to indicate the relative level of adoption. The individual scores for all ten dimensions were aggregated for each respondent and standardized to obtain a composite index value. The formula used was: <span id="eq-eq1"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Ctext%7BAgroecology%20Adoption%20Index%20(AAI)%7D%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Csum_%7Bi=1%7D%5E%7Bn%7D%20X_%7Bi%7D%7D%7Bn%7D%0A%5Ctag%7B1%7D"></span></p>
<p>where X<sub>i</sub> represents the score (frequency of codes) obtained in each dimension and n is the total number of dimensions this study.</p>
<p>The resulting index values were classified into three categories i.e.&nbsp;Low, Medium and High based on the distribution of scores (mean ± standard deviation). This index provided a comprehensive measure of the level of agroecology adoption among farmers, integrating ecological, social and economic dimensions into a single analytical framework.</p>
<p>Descriptive statistics such as mean, standard deviation, frequency and percentage were used to analyse the socio-economic characteristics of respondents and to provide a clear profile of the farming households. The relationship between socio-economic variables and the level of agroecology adoption was examined using correlation analysis to identify significant influencing factors.</p>
<p>For identifying and prioritising the constraints faced by farmers in adopting agroecological practices, Garrett Ranking Technique was employed. The major constraints identified during the preliminary survey were arranged in ascending order of importance by the farmers and converted into ranks using Garrett’s formula. These ranks were then transformed into scores with the help of Garrett’s table. The formula used for converting ranks into percentages is as follows: <span id="eq-eq2"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Ctext%7BPercent%20Position%7D%20=%20100%20%5Cleft(%20%5Cfrac%7BR_%7Bij%7D%20-%200.5%7D%7BN_%7Bj%7D%7D%20%5Cright)%0A%5Ctag%7B2%7D"></span></p>
<p>where R<sub>ij</sub> = the rank assigned to the i<sup>th</sup> constraint experienced by the j<sup>th</sup> individual represents the position or order of importance given by each respondent to a specific constraint based on their perception and experience and N<sub>j</sub> = the number of constraints ranked by the j<sup>th</sup> individual</p>

<p>A total of 40 farmers were selected for the study, and the results show that farmers in Meghalaya exhibited moderate levels of agroecological adoption influenced by socio-economic and psychological factors. About, 55.00 percent of middle-aged farmers demonstrate an optimal blend of experience and adaptability conducive to sustainable practices. Around 37.50 percent of small landholding farmers promote mixed farming and resource recycling, reflecting indigenous ecological knowledge. A significant 75.00 percent of farmers depend primarily on rainfed agriculture, with only 25.00 percent utilizing irrigation sources such as tube wells and ponds, highlighting the need for improved water management. Moderate income, evident in 85.00 percent of farmers and family labour availability support crop-livestock integration, enhancing resilience. However, renewable energy adoption remains low at 35.00 percent. Positive attitudes observed in 52.50 percent of farmers and moderate risk-taking, at 45.00 percent, contributing to gradual agroecology adoption, yet weak market orientation and limited institutional support continue to constrain broader uptake.</p>
<p>Given in Table&nbsp;1, the correlation analysis shows that landholding size (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%20=%200.482%5E%7B**%7D">), annual income (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%20=%200.468%5E%7B**%7D">), crop component diversity (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%20=%200.527%5E%7B**%7D">) and livestock component (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%20=%200.498%5E%7B**%7D">) have strong, significant positive relationships with agroecological adoption. Irrigation access (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%20=%200.356%5E%7B*%7D">) and renewable energy use (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%20=%200.302%5E%7B*%7D">) are also significant, indicating the importance of infrastructure and resource availability. Among psychosocial factors, risk-taking ability (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%20=%200.411%5E%7B**%7D">), attitude (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%20=%200.563%5E%7B**%7D">) and innovativeness (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%20=%200.474%5E%7B**%7D">) show significant positive correlations, highlighting their influence on adoption behaviour. However, age (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%20=%200.214">), family size (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%20=%200.188">) and market orientation (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%20=%200.245">) show positive but non-significant correlations. Lastly, nutrition, culture and tradition (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%20=%200.338%5E%7B*%7D">) show a significant correlation.

<p>The Agroecology adoption index (AAI) for Selsella block in Meghalaya showed a moderate overall average adoption score of 68.10 percent, presented in Table&nbsp;2, indicating farms are transitioning toward agroecology. According to <span class="citation" data-cites="fao2019tape">(FAO [Food and Agriculture Organization] 2019)</span>, farms scoring below 50.00 percent are considered non-agroecological systems, those scoring between 50.00 and 70.00 percent are classified as in transition to agroecological farms, while farms scoring above 70.00 percent are categorized as agroecological farms.</p>
<p>“High” adoption was recorded in Diversity (72.10%), Synergies (70.50%) and Circular Economy (70.40%), reflecting diversified production and resource recycling rooted in traditional knowledge. “Medium” adoption was observed in Efficiency, Recycling, Resilience, Knowledge Sharing and Human &amp; Social Values, showing partial institutionalization.” “Lower” adoption in Culture, Traditions (65.50%) and Governance (65.40%) indicates limited formal support and integration of indigenous cultural values. These results reveal progressive agroecological transition driven by diversification and synergy but constrained by governance and institutional gaps.</p>

<p>As given in Figure&nbsp;2 The study identified and ranked the major constraints hindering the adoption of agroecological practices. The study identifies limited market access (mean score 74.20) as the foremost constraint confronting farmers, significantly impeding their ability to connect agricultural produce with dependable buyers and efficient value chains. This challenge restricts market opportunities and adversely affects farm incomes. These findings corroborate earlier research by <span class="citation" data-cites="akoijam2018exploring">(Akoijam 2018)</span>, underscoring the persistent issue of inadequate market linkages as a critical barrier to agricultural advancement in Meghalaya.</p>
<p>The lack of training and education on agroecological practices ranked second (mean score 70.80), highlighting the need for systematic capacity-building initiatives to strengthen farmer’s understanding and adoption of agroecological principles. Limited knowledge on agroecology was the third major constraint (mean score 68.60), suggesting that while awareness of sustainable practices exists, deeper technical knowledge remains insufficient <span class="citation" data-cites="krishnan2024performance">(Krishnan et al. 2024)</span>.</p>
<p>The lack of efficient value chains (66.30) and few policies based on agroecology (63.90) occupied the fourth and fifth ranks respectively, reflecting institutional and infrastructural gaps in promoting an enabling ecosystem for agroecological transition.</p>
<p>Lower-ranked constraints such as government subsidies favouring synthetic inputs (61.70), lack of assured market price (59.50) and climate variability (56.80) indicate systemic barriers that indirectly limit farmer’s motivation to adopt sustainable practices. The high initial investment for farm transition (54.20) and limited access to credit or finance (51.40) were ranked lowest, suggesting that although financial constraints exist, knowledge and market-related factors are perceived as more immediate challenges.</p>
<p>Overall, these findings emphasize that market accessibility, farmer education and institutional support are key determinants influencing the adoption and sustainability of agroecological farming systems in Meghalaya. Strengthening local markets, developing value chains and implementing dedicated agroecology policies could substantially mitigate these constraints.</p>

<h2 data-number="4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="discussion"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Discussion</h2>
<p>The study shows that agroecology adoption in Meghalaya is influenced by farmers’ socio-economic and psychological characteristics. Middle-aged farmers adopt more, likely due to their practical experience and adaptability, aligning with <span class="citation" data-cites="singh2024review">(Singh 2024)</span>, who noted that experiential knowledge increases openness to sustainable innovations. Likewise, the tendency of small landholding farmers to practice mixed farming corresponds with <span class="citation" data-cites="tiwari2018shifting">(Tiwari and Pant 2018)</span>, who reported that indigenous farming systems in Meghalaya encourage integrated practices due to land constraints.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the heavy reliance on rainfed agriculture underscores structural limitations in rural infrastructure, aligning with findings by <span class="citation" data-cites="tyngkan2022determinants">(Tyngkan et al. 2022)</span>, who identified water insecurity as a key constraint to sustainable agricultural intensification in the region. Moderate income and family labour encourage crop–livestock integration, enhancing nutrient cycling and resilience. However, the low adoption of renewable energy reflects technological and financial barriers, a trend similarly reported by <span class="citation" data-cites="krishnan2024performance">(Krishnan et al. 2024)</span> in their analysis of sustainable technology uptake in hill farming systems. Psychological attributes, including positive attitudes and risk-taking ability, play a supportive role in gradual agroecological adoption. These findings are consistent with <span class="citation" data-cites="vikas2024agroecological">(Vikas and Ranjan 2024)</span>. Weak market orientation and limited institutional support hinder wider scaling, consistent with Akoijam (2018), who reported that inadequate market linkages and weak extension services remain major bottlenecks in Meghalaya’s agricultural sector.</p>
<p>The correlation analysis shows that socio-economic and psychological factors influence agroecological adoption. Larger landholdings, higher income and stronger market orientation support adoption, while limited resources restrict it. These results align with <span class="citation" data-cites="das2024gender Nonglait2023">(T. K. Das, Borah, and Singh 2024; Nonglait, Khundrakpam, and Deka 2023)</span>, who found that weak market linkages, poor institutional support and resource constraints hinder agroecological progress in Meghalaya. Similarly, the significant correlations for crop components and livestock integration show that diversified farming strengthens ecological resilience, consistent with Tiwari and Pant (2018). Access to irrigation and renewable energy also showed positive associations, indicating that better water availability and sustainable energy use help facilitate the shift toward agroecological practice. This trend supports the argument by Krishnan et al.&nbsp;(2024) who reported that infrastructural support is essential for sustaining ecological transitions in rainfed and hill-based systems.</p>
<p>In addition to that, psychological factors such as attitude, risk-taking ability and innovativeness, were among the strongest predictors of adoption. These results align with, <span class="citation" data-cites="Gokul2025agronomic">(Gokul et al. 2025)</span>, who emphasized that farmers’ mindset, openness to new ideas and willingness to take risks significantly enhance the likelihood of adopting agroecological practices. Lastly, the positive correlation of nutrition, culture and tradition indicates the continued influence of indigenous knowledge in promoting ecological farming. This is consistent with <span class="citation" data-cites="nicholls2018pathways">(Nicholls and Altieri 2018)</span>, who emphasized the role of cultural heritage in sustaining agroecological practices.</p>
<p>The results of the Agroecology adoption index reveal that farmers in Meghalaya are undergoing a gradual but uneven transition toward agroecology. The high scores in Diversity, Synergies and Circular Economy indicates strong indigenous practices in diversified cropping and resource recycling. This aligns with the findings of <span class="citation" data-cites="Rai2022">(Rai and Gurung 2022)</span>, who noted that traditional mixed farming systems in Northeast India form a strong foundation for agroecological intensification. Medium adoption levels in Efficiency, Recycling, Resilience, Knowledge Sharing and Human &amp; Social Values suggest that while farmers are integrating ecological principles, these dimensions are not yet fully institutionalized. Similar patterns were reported by <span class="citation" data-cites="Muthukumar2023">(Muthukumar and Joseph 2023)</span>, who observed that farmers adopt ecological practices informally but lack structured training, extension support and technical guidance. The low adoption in Culture, Traditions and Governance reflects gaps in the formal recognition of indigenous cultural systems within agricultural planning. This governance limitation observed in the present study aligns with the conclusion by <span class="citation" data-cites="Chaudhury2023">(Chaudhury and Basumatary 2023)</span>, who reported that inadequate institutional backing slows the formal scaling of agroecology despite strong community-level ecological knowledge.</p>
<p>The results of the constraint analysis reveal that farmers in the Selsella block encounter multiple barriers that limit the adoption of agroecological practices. Limited market access was the most critical constraint, linked to poor infrastructure and low price realization. This aligns with <span class="citation" data-cites="Marak2022">(Marak and Choudhury 2022)</span>, who noted that weak market linkages restrict farmers’ access to profitable value chains. The lack of training and education, identified as the second major constraint. This observation aligns with <span class="citation" data-cites="Ralte2023">(Ralte and Joseph 2023)</span>, who emphasized that limited skill development restricts farmers from adopting ecologically intensive farming systems.</p>
<p>Limited knowledge about agroecology, despite general awareness, was ranked as the third major constraint. This aligns with <span class="citation" data-cites="Goswami2024">(Goswami and Tiwari 2024)</span>, who found that hill-region farmers understand sustainability concepts but lack the technical skills to implement agroecological practices effectively. Institutional shortcomings such as inefficient value chains and limited policy support, also hinder farmers’ transition. These results align with <span class="citation" data-cites="Sarmah2023">(Sarmah and Debbarma 2023)</span>, who found that weak governance structures and inadequate policy frameworks slows agroecological scaling in Northeast India. Subsidies favouring synthetic inputs, unstable market prices, and climate variability, further challenge adoption. Similar issues were highlighted by <span class="citation" data-cites="Kumar2024">(Kumar and Sen 2024)</span>, who reported that existing subsidy systems and price fluctuations discourage long-term ecological investment. Although financial barriers like high initial investment and limited credit access were ranked lower, they still remain relevant, similar patterns were observed by <span class="citation" data-cites="Das2022">(R. Das and Nongrum 2022)</span>.</p>

<h2 data-number="5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion"><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Conclusion</h2>
<p>This study examined agroecological adoption in the Selsella block of Meghalaya and found a moderate transition level, influenced by farmers’ socio-economic characteristics, diversified farming practices and positive attitudes, but constrained by limited irrigation, weak market access and inadequate institutional support. The Agroecology adoption index score of 68.10% highlights strengths in Diversity, Synergy and Circular Economy, while revealing gaps in Governance and cultural integration. Major constraints include poor market connectivity, limited training and weak policy support. Strengthening market linkages, expanding farmer training and improving policy frameworks are essential to increase adoption and support sustainable rural development. By documenting the multidimensional status of agroecological adoption this study provides empirical evidence from a tribal rainfed region, where limited research exists. It offers policy-relevant insights into the socio-economic and institutional factors and contributes to policy development by identifying priority areas, such as market infrastructure, extension support, farmer training and governance mechanisms, that can guide future state-level strategies and frameworks aimed at scaling agroecology in Meghalaya.</p>

<p>Agriculture serves as the foundation of global food systems, supporting human sustenance, economic stability, and environmental sustainability. Its effectiveness largely depends on the decisions and preferences of farmers, consumers, and policymakers. Choices such as selecting resilient crop varieties and inputs, implementing sustainable farming practices, and responding to consumer demand influence productivity and yields while shaping ecological outcomes, biodiversity conservation, and the equitable allocation of resources. Moreover, understanding these preferences enables producers and policymakers to align agricultural outputs with consumer needs, ensuring that market demand is met efficiently and sustainably.Gaining insights into stakeholder preferences is therefore essential for designing effective agricultural policies, promoting technology adoption, and developing marketing strategies <span class="citation" data-cites="Custodio2023 Sawassi2025">(Custodio, Demont, and De Steur 2023; Sawassi et al. 2025)</span>.</p>
<p>Over the years, several preference elicitation and scaling techniques, such as Likert scales, rating, ranking, and pairwise comparison methods, have been widely employed in agricultural and consumer research. Likert and rating scales capture perceived importance or agreement, while ranking methods require respondents to order all items simultaneously, which can become cognitively demanding as the number of attributes increases. Pairwise comparisons simplify the task but still fail to reflect the relative importance among multiple competing attributes. As noted by <span class="citation" data-cites="Parvin2016">Parvin (2016)</span>, these methods tend to be cognitively more demanding and are susceptible to response and scale-use biases, which can compromise the reliability and comparability of results across respondents.</p>
<p>Best-Worst Scaling (BWS) is a stated preference method, developed by Jordan J Louviere in 1987, that addresses these limitations by asking respondents to identify both the most and least important items within a choice set. Unlike traditional rating or ranking methods, which require evaluating all items simultaneously, BWS divides the task into smaller, more cognitively manageable parts, simplifying the process and helping respondents make more distinct trade-offs between attributes<span class="citation" data-cites="Erdem2012">(Erdem, Rigby, and Wossink 2012)</span>. This approach captures the extremes in the inclinations of respondents and reduces the cognitive burden on respondents, making it easier for the surveyor to obtain more accurate and reliable responses with reduced biases <span class="citation" data-cites="Kiritchenko2017">(Kiritchenko and Mohammad 2017)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="Burton2021">(Burton et al. 2021)</span>.</p>
<p>Three main variants of BWS, Case 1 (Object case), Case 2 (Profile case), and Case 3 (Multi-profile case), facilitate identifying preferences according to the context and the nature of items or profiles to be evaluated. Case 1 is the simplest form of BWS, allowing respondents to choose the best and worst items in a list and make a relative ranking of the items <span class="citation" data-cites="Flynn2014">Flynn and Marley (2014)</span>. Cases 2 and 3 deal with profiles which are combinations of levels of attributes. In the profile case, choices are made within the individual profiles, whereas in the multi-profile case, choices are made between whole profiles <span class="citation" data-cites="Louviere2015 Cheung2016">(J. J. Louviere, Flynn, and Marley 2015; Cheung et al. 2016)</span>.</p>
<p>While previous reviews have examined the methodological evolution and applications of BWS across disciplines <span class="citation" data-cites="Schuster2024 Hollin2022 Beres2024">(Schuster et al. 2024; Hollin et al. 2022; Beres et al. 2024)</span>, most have centred on health and policy domains. Comprehensive analyses focusing specifically on the agricultural sector remain limited. The present review aims to address this gap by systematically examining the use of BWS within agricultural research, highlighting methodological developments, thematic areas, and conceptual contributions. By integrating evidence and perspectives from existing studies, the review presents a coherent narrative on the expanding role of BWS in shaping preference-based research within agriculture.</p>

<h2 data-number="2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="statistical-foundations-of-bws"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Statistical foundations of BWS</h2>
<p>The Random Utility Theory (RUT) underpins the fundamental principle of BWS <span class="citation" data-cites="Beres2024">Beres et al. (2024)</span>, which states that individuals make their choices based on the perceived utility characteristics or the characteristics of a product, which comprises observable attributes and some unobservable random component, as shown in Equation&nbsp;1.</p>
<p><span id="eq-eq1"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AU_%7Bij%7D%20=%20V_%7Bij%7D%20+%20%5Cvarepsilon_%7Bij%7D%0A%5Ctag%7B1%7D"></span></p>
<p>where U<sub>ij</sub> is the total utility of the j<sup>th</sup> item for the i<sup>th</sup> consumer, V<sub>ij</sub> denote the utility from the observed characteristics, and ε<sub>ij</sub> is the random component. The stochastic component implies that while exact choices cannot be predicted, the probability of each alternative being selected can be estimated statistically <span class="citation" data-cites="Adikari2024">Adikari and Diawara (2024)</span>.</p>
<p>In the context of BWS, this framework can be used to compare the ‘best’ and ‘worst’ choices of an individual.By requiring respondents to identify both extremes of preference within each choice set, BWS captures a fuller range of the utility distribution compared to traditional choice experiments. According to RUT, an item’s relative preference compared to others depends on how frequently it is chosen <span class="citation" data-cites="Louviere2013">(J. Louviere et al. 2013)</span>. Recent methodological developments have further extended RUT to account for individual-level preference heterogeneity, allowing researchers to better understand differences in choices across respondents <span class="citation" data-cites="Holmes2017">(Holmes, Adamowicz, and Carlsson 2017)</span>.</p>
<p>In agricultural research, RUT and BWS provide a framework for examining how different stakeholders evaluate competing options such as crop varieties, input combinations, market choices, or policy measures, based on perceived benefits and trade-offs. By linking observable attributes like yield, price, sustainability, and quality with individual preferences, BWS enables researchers to quantify the relative importance of these factors, offering valuable insights into agricultural decision-making.</p>

<h2 data-number="3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="experimental-designs-in-bws"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Experimental Designs in BWS</h2>
<p>The efficiency of a BWS study depends critically on the construction of choice sets in the questionnaire. Asking respondents to rank a large number of items can create cognitive strain and reduce data quality. <span class="citation" data-cites="Parvin2016">Parvin (2016)</span> noted out that it is challenging for the respondents to rank more than seven items in a single choice set. To address this, BWS organizes the items into smaller and manageable choice sets, typically containing three to six items each, allowing respondents to make meaningful comparisons without fatigue.</p>
<p>A statistically efficient design ensures that each item or attribute level appears an equal number of times across all choice sets, and that every possible pair of items co-occurs equally often with similar frequency <span class="citation" data-cites="Lee2008">Lee, Soutar, and Louviere (2008)</span>. This balance and orthogonality in the design facilitate the derivation of precise and reliable preference estimates.</p>
<p>Early BWS studies used 2<sup>J</sup> designs <span class="citation" data-cites="Flynn2014">Flynn and Marley (2014)</span> to generate choice sets, where J represents the number of items. However, as the number of items increases, the number of possible combinations grows exponentially, making such designs impractical for real-world surveys and burdensome for respondents. To overcome this challenge, recent studies employ Balanced Incomplete Block Design (BIBD) to generate combinations of items in each choice set, as it ensures the balanced occurrence and co-occurrence of objects. This approach is commonly used in the BWS object case (Case 1), where individual items are evaluated directly by respondents, allowing for manageable questionnaires without compromising statistical efficiency.</p>
<p>In profile and multi-profile cases, the focus shifts from single items to combinations of attributes that define a product or alternative. Here, the profiles are created using Orthogonal Arrays (OA). If there are K attributes, each with L<sub>k</sub> (k = 1, 2, …, K) levels, an L<sup>K</sup> OA can be used to create profiles while maintaining orthogonality. Each profile is considered as a choice set in BWS case 2, while in Case 3 multiple profiles are combined into choice sets using BIBD. This approach allows researchers to estimate the relative importance of individual attributes and their levels, while keeping the task manageable for respondents <span class="citation" data-cites="AizakiFogarty2019 Aizaki2021">(Aizaki and Fogarty 2019; Aizaki 2021)</span>.</p>

<p>Depending on the complexity of the data and objectives of the research, different analytical models are employed to extract insights from best–worst choices. These models range from simple counting approaches, which provide a basic understanding of preference patterns, to more sophisticated econometric models capable of capturing heterogeneity in preferences.</p>

<h3 data-number="4.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="counting-approach"><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Counting approach</h3>
<p>The counting method, which involves the frequencies of each item being selected as ‘best’ and ‘worst,’ is a simple yet effective approach used to analyse BWS data <span class="citation" data-cites="Burns2022">Burns et al. (2022)</span>. The Best-Worst (B-W) score is obtained by subtracting the number of times an item is marked as worst (Wᵢ) from the number of times it is marked as best (Bᵢ), which is then divided by the total number of respondents (n) and the frequency of an item appeared in each choice set (r) to get the standardised score (Equation&nbsp;2;Equation&nbsp;3) <span class="citation" data-cites="Massey2015 Yin2023">(Massey et al. 2015; Yin, Kamimura, and Imoto 2023)</span>. The Square root B-W score (Equation&nbsp;4) and Standard B-W score (Equation&nbsp;5) also represent the preferences <span class="citation" data-cites="Torok2023">Torok et al. (2023)</span>.</p>

<h3 data-number="4.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="modelling-approaches"><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Modelling approaches</h3>
<p>Statistical models grounded in econometric theory and probabilistic frameworks enable rigorous estimation of preference parameters. Modelling approaches provide greater analytical precision and account for response heterogeneity, compared to count-based methods. These models estimate the likelihood of an individual choosing a particular item as ‘best’ or ‘worst’. The probabilistic model represented in Equation&nbsp;6 forms the theoretical foundation for the statistical models used in the analysis of BWS data. It considers a finite set of alternatives and estimates the probability of selecting an item as best, worst, or jointly as a best–worst pair based on underlying choice processes <span class="citation" data-cites="Marley2005">(A. A. Marley and Louviere 2005)</span>.</p>

<p>where B<sub>X</sub>(x) is the probability that the alternative x is chosen as best in X, W<sub>X</sub>(y) is the probability that the alternative y is chosen as worst in X, and BW<sub>X</sub>(x, y) is the joint probability of the alternative x is chosen as best in X and the alternative y ≠ x is chosen as worst in X.</p>
<p>Advanced models can capture preference heterogeneity across respondents that arises due to geographic, socioeconomic, or behavioural factors. This can be used in agricultural studies to identify the difference in choices of farmers and consumers based on farm size, access to resources, and individual-level factors.</p>

<h4 data-number="4.2.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="multinomial-logit-model-mnl"><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1</span> Multinomial Logit Model (MNL)</h4>
<p>MNL is based on the assumption that the preferences of individuals in a population are homogeneous. The joint probability of selecting an item as best and another as worst within a choice set is used to estimate the preference for that item <span class="citation" data-cites="Marley2015a">(A. A. J. Marley, Flynn, and Australia 2015)</span>. Conceptually, the MNL model represents the probability of choosing a specific best–worst pair based on the relative utilities of the available items in a choice set. This probabilistic framework allows the model to capture the trade-offs respondents make when identifying their most and least preferred items. The resulting estimates provide a population-level measure of preference intensity of each item compared to a reference, making the MNL a fundamental model for advanced analyses of best–worst data <span class="citation" data-cites="Cheung2019">(Cheung et al. 2019)</span>.</p>

<p>LCA is a cluster analysis method used to uncover the unobserved heterogeneity among respondents when observable characteristics alone cannot form homogeneous groups. Based on this, respondents will be categorised into different latent classes sharing hidden attributes that can affect the selection. The optimal number of clusters is determined by statistical fit criteria such as Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and McFadden’s Pseudo R-squared (ρ²), which are commonly used to assess model performance <span class="citation" data-cites="Cheung2019 Barrowclough2023 Merlino2025">(Cheung et al. 2019; Barrowclough et al. 2023; Merlino et al. 2025)</span>.</p>

It is a generalisation of MNL, used to estimate the individual heterogeneity in preferences. Unlike the MNL, which assumes uniform preferences across respondents, the RPL allows parameters to vary randomly within the population, implying that different people have different preferences.

<p>Three different choice modelling methods, paired, marginal, and marginal sequential models, are used to analyse the responses obtained from a BWS case 2 survey. All models assume that each attribute level provides some utility to the respondent, but differ in how the best and worst levels are determined. The utility of the level chosen as worst is considered the negative of the utility of the level selected as best.</p>
<p>The paired model identifies that the chosen best–worst pair represents the largest utility difference among all possible pairs in the set. The marginal model assumes that the best level has the maximum utility and the worst level the minimum utility among all levels, whereas in the marginal sequential model, the best level has the maximum utility among all levels and the worst level the minimum utility among the remaining levels.</p>
<p>In all three models, the estimated coefficients indicate the relative preference of respondents for each attribute level, providing insights into the trade-offs made when identifying the most and least important options <span class="citation" data-cites="AizakiFogarty2019">(Aizaki and Fogarty 2019)</span>.</p>

<p>A bibliometric analysis was conducted using the bibliometrix package <span class="citation" data-cites="AriaCuccurullo2017">(Aria and Cuccurullo 2017)</span> in R to examine studies employing BWS to elicit choices in agricultural contexts. The Dimensions database was selected for its broad coverage of multidisciplinary research <span class="citation" data-cites="Hook2018">(Hook, Porter, and Herzog 2018)</span>. Publications from 2011 to 2025 were retrieved using the search string: (“Best-Worst Scaling” OR “BWS”) AND (“agriculture” OR “farm” OR “food”). The search was limited to peer-reviewed journal articles and conference papers published in English, ensuring the inclusion of relevant and high-quality academic outputs. Although larger datasets can be obtained from other databases, the export restrictions in these platforms limit their use for the present analysis. The selection of Dimensions thus ensured consistency, transparency, and replicability of the bibliometric workflow.</p>
<p>After screening for relevance and removing duplicates, a total of 75 documents from 54 sources were retained for analysis. The chosen timespan captures both the emergence and evolution of BWS applications in agriculture, beginning with the earliest identifiable studies in 2011. The relatively small corpus reflects the recent adoption of BWS in this field and the method’s growing recognition as a robust alternative to traditional preference elicitation approaches. This also indicates a research gap and an opportunity for further exploration of BWS across diverse agricultural decision-making contexts.</p>
<p>These records were analysed to interpret the research trends, current status, thematic distribution, advancements, and interrelationships among studies in this field. The analysis revealed an increasing trend in the scientific production, as shown in Figure&nbsp;1, with an overall growth rate of 13.65% during the study period. The highest number of publications occurred in 2025, followed by 2020. From 2011 to 2017, the publication activity remained relatively stable and gained acceleration from 2018 onward, indicating a growing interest in BWS-based agricultural studies.</p>

<p>The bibliometric findings reveal a steady growth in the use of BWS within agricultural research over the past fifteen years. The method’s expanding adoption across countries and journals reflects its growing credibility as a reliable approach for capturing stakeholder preferences and supporting evidence-based decision-making. Although the number of retrieved publications is modest, this primarily reflects database-specific constraints and the relatively recent integration of BWS into agricultural research workflows. The observed trends highlight the increasing recognition of BWS as a valuable tool for understanding preferences in agricultural decision-making, signifying its potential for broader application in future agricultural studies.</p>

<p>The application of BWS in the agricultural sector has increased significantly over the years. The bibliometric analysis substantiates that there is a growing trend in its application from 2011 to 2025. The involvement of smaller choice sets and the ability to capture nuanced distinctions in preferences made BWS a more preferred method of choice evaluation over the traditional rating and ranking methods. This section examines the major studies that have employed BWS to understand the preferences of agricultural stakeholders.</p>
<p>The reviewed body of literature demonstrates that BWS has been applied across a broad spectrum of agricultural contexts, encompassing consumer behaviour, farm management, sustainability practices, policy evaluation, and genetic improvement. Table&nbsp;1 presents an overview of the reviewed studies, summarising the types of BWS and the analytical methods used in different research contexts. It illustrates the wide range of agricultural and allied topics where BWS has been applied, with the three cases of BWS being applied to address distinct study objectives.</p>
<p>Among the reviewed literature, BWS Case 1 is the dominant one, featuring in the majority of publications. Research by <span class="citation" data-cites="BavieraPuig2025">(Baviera-Puig et al. 2025)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="Uliano2025">(Uliano and Lerro 2025)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="Wardyani2025">(Wardyani et al. 2025)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="Cammarelle2024">(Cammarelle et al. 2024)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="Torok2023">(Torok et al. 2023)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="AizakiTakeshita2023">(Aizaki and Takeshita 2023)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="Giuggioli2023">(Giuggioli et al. 2023)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="Chrysochou2022">(Chrysochou et al. 2022)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="Sarma2020">(Sarma 2020)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="Massaglia2019">(Massaglia et al. 2019)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="Bazzani2016">(Bazzani et al. 2016)</span>, and <span class="citation" data-cites="Dekhili2011">(Dekhili, Sirieix, and Cohen 2011)</span> used Case 1 to identify the preference patterns of consumers in the purchase of different agricultural products. It has also been employed to capture the choice behaviour of farmers regarding the selection of farm inputs as given in <span class="citation" data-cites="Ahoudou2023">(Ahoudou et al. 2023)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="Burns2022">(Burns et al. 2022)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="Maruyama2022">(Maruyama et al. 2022)</span>, and <span class="citation" data-cites="Aizaki2016">(Aizaki et al. 2016)</span>. The studies by <span class="citation" data-cites="Merlino2025">(Merlino et al. 2025)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="Liu2025">(Liu et al. 2025)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="Zander2024">(Zander et al. 2024)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="Aizaki2025">(Aizaki, Akahori, and Yamamoto 2025)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="Chang2022">(Chang et al. 2022)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="Bhatta2022">(Bhatta, Zander, and Garnett 2022)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="Caputo2020">(Caputo and Lusk 2020)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="Jackson2020">(Jackson et al. 2020)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="Dumbrell2016">(Dumbrell, Kragt, and Gibson 2016)</span>, and <span class="citation" data-cites="Cross2012">(Cross, Rigby, and Edwards-Jones 2012)</span> adopted BWS to analyse different agricultural technologies, practices, and policies. Additionally, <span class="citation" data-cites="Ibe2024">(Ibe et al. 2024)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="Burns2022">(Burns et al. 2022)</span> applied BWS to support genetic breeding activities, while <span class="citation" data-cites="AttaMicheels2020">(Atta and Micheels 2020)</span> identified the risks in agricultural production through an object case study.</p>
<p>BWS Cases 2 and 3 appeared in fewer studies which evaluated different attributes or profiles. These studies explored themes such as consumer choices <span class="citation" data-cites="AizakiSato2020 Ola2020 Mizuki2025 Rolfe2023">(Aizaki and Sato 2020; Ola and Menapace 2020; Mizuki and Yasue 2025; Rolfe et al. 2023)</span>, production strategies <span class="citation" data-cites="Sackett2013 Chelanga2025 Shittu2021">(Sackett, Shupp, and Tonsor 2013; Chelang’a et al. 2025; Shittu et al. 2021)</span>, and agricultural policies <span class="citation" data-cites="Guo2020">(Guo and Shen 2020)</span>.</p>
<p>Across the reviewed studies, the analysis of the data is widely done through count-based methods as well as advanced modelling methods, including MNL, LCA, HB, and RPL, to capture different patterns of preference heterogeneity among respondents. Many of the researchers have applied LCA to identify the latent characteristics that can influence decision-making.</p>
<p>Collectively, these applications underscore the practical value of BWS in guiding agricultural innovation, marketing, and policymaking. By quantifying what stakeholders value most and least, BWS contributes to evidence-based strategies that align agricultural development with stakeholder priorities. Beyond identifying preferences, BWS has provided actionable insights that have informed marketing strategies, guided policy priorities, and shaped technology adoption frameworks. The studies applying BWS to consumer choice contexts have refined the design and marketing of agri-food products, while farmer-oriented studies have supported evidence-based input subsidy and risk management programs. Policy-oriented research has aided in prioritising sustainability measures and resource allocation in line with stakeholder values. Overall, the methodological rigour and interpretive strength of BWS have enabled a deeper understanding of stakeholder preferences and their translation into practically relevant interventions. The growing body of evidence positions BWS as a bridge between preference research and real-world agricultural policymaking.</p>

<h2 data-number="7" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion"><span class="header-section-number">7</span> Conclusion</h2>
<p>The application of BWS in agricultural research has been increasing rapidly in recent years, as confirmed by the bibliometric analysis, with the object case (Case 1) emerging as the most commonly employed. BWS proves to be a significant tool in the field of agriculture for understanding farmer preferences and consumer choices. By capturing the most and least preferred items, it enables the relative ranking of attributes. This knowledge helps the researchers to prioritise the traits for product development and trend prediction, enabling policymakers to use the interpretations obtained from BWS to frame policies.</p>
<p>The review underscores that the three cases of BWS facilitate more precise measurement of preferences in different contexts of agricultural studies, such as environmental sustainability, productivity, and cost-related trade-offs. By providing a robust statistical foundation, BWS supports more informed policy formulation and management decisions. It effectively addresses the limitations of traditional preference measurement techniques and offers a comprehensive understanding of stakeholder choices through the adoption of advanced modelling approaches. Consequently, BWS enables more targeted and effective interventions in the field of agriculture.</p>
<p>Careful experimental design, precise statistical analysis, and thoughtful interpretation of results will open up new avenues for applying BWS in agricultural research. Future research should focus on developing more efficient experimental designs that better capture heterogeneity in responses. As noted by <span class="citation" data-cites="Gopinath2021">(Gopinath et al. 2021)</span>, developing robust, open-source web applications with intuitive, interactive interfaces can make agricultural data analysis more accessible for researchers. Such platforms and software tools can promote wider adoption of BWS in the agricultural sector, from on-farm management to policy making.</p>

<p>Every step taken towards reduction in postharvest loss has a direct relation to nutritional and sensory quality <span class="citation" data-cites="ziv2021postharvest">(Ziv and Fallik 2021)</span>. Sensory quality plays an important role in consumer acceptance of a product or produce. Sensory evaluation is an information-gathering process and a multidisciplinary science, including food science, psychology, statistics, and home economics, which measures, analyses, and interprets humans’ behavioural responses to different products based on the five senses of sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch. This helps in understanding consumer preferences <span class="citation" data-cites="Sharif2017 Stone2020 yu2018design">(Sharif et al. 2017; Stone, Bleibaum, and Thomas 2020; Yu, Low, and Zhou 2018)</span>. Sensory experiments are controlled scientific studies conducted to understand sensory preferences by human panels. This article covers the different experimental designs, analysis methods, and software packages used in sensory studies, whose understanding helps in conducting proper sensory analysis.</p>
<p>In order to conduct a sensory experiment, an objective should be formulated. Depending on the objectives there are different methods for sensory evaluation such as affective test, discrimination test, descriptive test and quality test. Different situations in which the tests can be adopted has been shown below in Table&nbsp;1.</p>

<p>Since human panels are involved, there are chances of occurrence of several errors. Designing of experiments is important for the proper conduct of these tests. It is a critically important tool for improving the product realisation process. Design provides structure and ease for carrying out experiments and provides useful outcomes <span class="citation" data-cites="Montgomery2017 RuizCapillas2021a RuizCapillas2021b">(Montgomery 2017; Ruiz-Capillas and Herrero 2021; Ruiz-Capillas et al. 2021)</span>. The use of the right statistical design and analysis procedure is very much essential for proper product development. A comprehensive review of the existing designs and their applications, various tests that can be adopted, as well as different software available for various tests, has been done in this paper. This will be useful for researchers working in the area of sensory experiments with less statistical background.</p>

<h2 data-number="2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="designs-and-approaches-in-sensory-experiments"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Designs And Approaches in Sensory Experiments</h2>
<p>In design of experiments, the objects of comparison such as the combination of ingredients or the conditions suitable for the development of a particular product, are termed as Treatments. Experimental units are the subjects or objects on which treatments are applied. In case of sensory experiments, the evaluators or the samples used for the sensory evaluation can be the experimental unit depending on the objective. Evaluators can also be called as panelists. The outcomes observed as a result of the treatment is termed as responses. Responses are also known as the dependent factors, since it is dependent on the independent factors, whose influence on a response variable is being studied in the experiment. For example, consider the study on the effect of poppy, sucrose, and citric acid on the taste, smell, colour, and general acceptance of a Turkish sherbet, as carried out by <span class="citation" data-cites="aydogdu2023poppy">Aydoğdu, Tokatlı Demirok, and Yıkmış (2023)</span>, where poppy, sucrose, and citric acid levels were the independent variables. The taste, smell, colour, and general acceptance were the dependent variables.</p>
<p>While designing an experiment, three basic principles are to be followed, viz.&nbsp;randomization, replication, and local control (blocking). Randomization ensures equal chances for each experimental unit to receive each treatment. Replication is the repetition of treatments to obtain more accurate results. In sensory experiments, blocks could be panelists or sessions <span class="citation" data-cites="das1986design gacula2008sensory jankovic2021doe Lawless2010 Montgomery2017">(Das and Giri 1986; Gacula 2008; Jankovic, Chaudhary, and Goia 2021; Lawless and Heymann 2010; Montgomery 2017)</span>. The number of panelists is decided based on the extent of training. If the panelists are trained, only five to ten panelists would be required; 25 panelists are needed if they are semi-trained, and at least 100 panelists are required if they are untrained. Different designs are available, and one can choose their design based on the objective of the experiment <span class="citation" data-cites="BIS1971">(Indian Standards et al. 1971)</span>. Through this paper, we intend to discuss various designs for sensory experiments and product formulation, as well as different analysis procedures to be adopted on the data generated.</p>

<h3 data-number="2.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="paired-comparison-design"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Paired comparison design</h3>
<p>If the objective of the experiment is to identify the effect of flavouring on liking, or to identify a preferred product between two products, paired comparison designs are used. Here, the panelists are provided with two samples, and since the evaluation is being done by the same panelists, the scores will be correlated <span class="citation" data-cites="gacula2008sensory">(Gacula 2008)</span>. The null hypothesis would be that the two samples have the same effect. The objective is to select the better formulation.</p>

<h3 data-number="2.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="group-comparison-design"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Group comparison design</h3>
<p>For the comparison of two formulations based on a standard, group comparison designs are used. There must only be a small variation in scores among panelists and fairly homogeneous experimental units for the design to give better results <span class="citation" data-cites="gacula2008sensory">(Gacula 2008)</span>. The null hypothesis would be that both of the formulations are similar to the standard. The objective is to identify the one which is more similar to the standard in terms of liking.</p>

<h3 data-number="2.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="completely-randomised-design-crd"><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Completely Randomised Design (CRD)</h3>
<p>When the comparison is among more than two formulations or combinations or characteristics, such as the effects of flavouring on liking, Completely Randomised Designs (CRD) are used. In CRD, treatments can be equally or unequally replicated and the experimental units are expected to be homogenous. The total number of samples would be the number of treatments × replication, and each sample would be given to the panelists <span class="citation" data-cites="Lawless2010">(Lawless and Heymann 2010)</span>. <span class="citation" data-cites="More2019">More and Chavan (2019)</span> had three treatments, five replications, and the total number of samples were 15. Five trained panelists evaluated all of the samples to analyse the effect of red pumpkin powder on burfi (sweet dish). The levels of red pumpkin powder were varied as 15 percent, 17 percent, and 19 percent, keeping condensed milk solids and sugar levels constant. Usually, in CRD, sensory fatigue occurs in panelists when samples are tasted continuously. To avoid that, Monadic designs are often associated with CRD. In monadic designs, panelists are divided into groups, and each group is given one treatment. In sequential monadic designs, each panellist is given all the treatments but not the replications. Monadic designs are better when the number of panelists is large <span class="citation" data-cites="Lawless2010">(Lawless and Heymann 2010)</span>. <span class="citation" data-cites="fatoretto2018tomatoes">Fatoretto et al. (2018)</span> conducted a sequential monadic experiment and gave two samples each of dehydrated Italian and grape tomatoes to each panellist. A total of 100 samples were made for 50 panelists. Other experiments that employed CRD include <span class="citation" data-cites="baclayon2020custard Suryani2016">(Baclayon, Cerna, and Cimafranca 2020; Suryani and Norhasanah 2016)</span>.</p>

<p>For the same objective of comparison among more than two formulations, but with blocking, Randomised Complete Block Design (RCBD) can be used. Blocks could be panelists or sessions. In RCBD, every treatment must be equally replicated. In sensory experiments, with panellist as a block, all the treatments will be given in a randomised order to a panellist and then, after a small break, all treatments are given again in some other order. The number of times this process is repeated will be the number of replications. Similarly, the treatments are given to all the other blocks <span class="citation" data-cites="silva2014bibd">(Silva et al. 2014)</span>. If session is a block, each panellist will be attending each session and testing each of the samples. Sessions could be divided into periods such that each treatment appears only once in each session. The total number of sessions will be the number of replications of each treatment <span class="citation" data-cites="chambers1981statistical">(Chambers, Bowers, and Dayton 1981)</span>.</p>

<h3 data-number="2.5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="balanced-incomplete-block-design-bibd"><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Balanced Incomplete Block Design (BIBD)</h3>
<p>When the number of treatments to be evaluated becomes larger, Balanced Incomplete Block Design (BIBD) is used. A BIBD is an arrangement of v treatments in b blocks such that there will be k(&lt;v) treatments in each block, each treatment will be repeated r times and every pair of treatments will be appearing together in λ(lambda) blocks. Here, any two blocks will have the same number of treatments, but the combinations can differ. These combinations should be arranged in such a manner that any two pairs occur the same number of times as any other pair. For example, <span class="citation" data-cites="silva2014bibd">Silva et al. (2014)</span> employed BIBD to compare five grape juices made from different pulp concentrations for six attributes such as violet colour, grape aroma, sweetness, sourness, grape flavour, and mouthfeel. In a block, only three treatments (juices of different pulp concentrations) were taken, and there were ten blocks (sessions). Similarly, <span class="citation" data-cites="hinneh2020chocolates">Hinneh et al. (2020)</span> employed BIBD for sensory profiling of chocolate in their experiment. Ten attributes; cocoa, acidity, astringency, bitterness, nuttiness, woodiness, floral, fresh fruit, browned fruit and spiciness were tested. The basic design had 16 chocolates (treatments) and 16 sessions, and in each session six chocolates were test. In BIBD, the number of sessions should at least equal the number of treatments.</p>

<p><span class="citation" data-cites="Saurav2017">Saurav et al. (2017)</span> developed this design specifically, to avoid carryover effect and reduce sensory fatigue. If there are v products to be tested, and ‘v’ is a prime number or prime power this design can be used. Here the number of panelists will also be ‘v’. ‘v’ can be denoted as v= 4t+1, 6t+1, or 4t+3, where ‘t’ is the number of sessions. Sessions are divided into periods such that total number of periods should be v-1 and each period should contain all the products. Order of products in each period is randomised such that a panellist should not be testing a single product more than once. After v-1 periods, each panellist will be testing v-1 products. This design is resolvable since in all the sessions each treatment is repeated the same number of times.</p>

The all-possible-combination approach and designs based on Mutually Orthogonal Latin Squares (MOLS) were also discussed. <span class="citation" data-cites="Rodrigues2017">Rodrigues et al.

A series of eight Sudoku designs were used four randomized independently and four others in the reverse order giving a 16 × 16 design. Sixteen panelists were assigned to test the 16 samples in random orders. The experiment had eight replications with different panelists, resulting in a total of 128 panelists. Here, the experimental unit was a particular order of 16 samples. <span class="citation" data-cites="Saurav2017">Saurav et al.

<p>RSM is a collection of statistical and mathematical techniques used for developing new products, improving existing products, and optimising production processes. Optimisation techniques are used for the estimation of interactions among the independent variables and their quadratic effects on response variables. Optimisation experiments could be mixture experiments or non-mixture experiments, based on the independent and response variables. In a mixture experiment, the response variable is dependent on the proportions of the independent variables. When the level of one of the ingredients changes, the levels of the others will also change accordingly so that the total proportion equals 1. In non-mixture experiments, changing the level of one of the ingredients does not affect the levels of the others <span class="citation" data-cites="gacula2008sensory">(Gacula 2008)</span>.

<p>CCD has an embedded factorial design and is preferred over 3<sup>k</sup> factorial to model a quadratic relationship because it requires fewer assays to achieve better modelling. Along with the experimental points of the factorial design, CCD considers additional points known as star points or axial points and centre points. However, a CCD includes extreme points, which is not advisable for special processes such as extraction of a compound sensitive to high temperature and pressure <span class="citation" data-cites="gacula2008sensory Myers2016">(Gacula 2008; Myers, Montgomery, and Anderson-Cook 2016)</span>. The total number of trials for the design is F + 2v + n<sub>c</sub>, where F is the number of factorial points, v is the number of factors, and n<sub>c</sub> is the number of centre points. In their study, <span class="citation" data-cites="Nahemiah2016">Nahemiah (2016)</span> considered three factors at two levels, and axial and centre points were included to obtain values at five levels.

<p>For designs with more than two treatments, and the data generated are normally distributed, ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) can be conducted. A normality test is recommended before proceeding with ANOVA. In ANOVA the total variation in the observed data is partitioned into different sources. Number of sources in ANOVA is dependent on the designs used. For example, in CRD the source of variation is from treatments, so one-way ANOVA is performed. And if RCBD is used, two-way ANOVA is performed where block effect is also accounted for. From ANOVA, F ratio statistic is obtained and if found significant, indicates that at least one treatment mean is significantly different from one or more treatments in the experiment. To identify the treatments that are similar, pairwise comparisons can be carried out using multiple comparison procedures. Least Significant Difference (LSD) test, Tukey’s test, and Duncan’s Multiple Range Test (DMRT) are some of the common multiple comparison tests used <span class="citation" data-cites="gacula2013statistical agbangba2024posthoc">(Gacula 2013; Agbangba et al. 2024)</span>.</p>

<p>T is the lowest significant difference, q is the critical value from the q distribution table, n<sub>i</sub> and n<sub>j</sub> are the number of scores used to calculate the means, r is the range, or the number of means being compared, df is the error degrees of freedom and MSE is the mean square error obtained from the results of the ANOVA test.

Second order response surface models are more suited for sensory experiments since it can represent more complex relationships <span class="citation" data-cites="Nwabueze2010">(Nwabueze 2010)</span>. Response surface plots are the visualisation of the effects of variables on the response. This could be two-dimensional contour maps or three-dimensional maps, providing an accurate geometric depiction. Plots are made by fitting regression model by keeping non-significant (P &gt; 0.05) variable constant and varying other variables. Optimal conditions are found out by superimposing the response surfaces <span class="citation" data-cites="Annor2009 Nwabueze2010 Myers2016">(Annor et al. 2009; Nwabueze 2010; Myers, Montgomery, and Anderson-Cook 2016)</span>. Both three dimensional and contour maps are observed together for better understanding. Since the minimum or maximum point is at the centre of the design space, the contour plots will show a circle or ellipse at the centre. When the target point is neither maximum nor minimum point (saddle point), the contour plots show parabolic or hyperbolic contours <span class="citation" data-cites="Myers2016">(Myers, Montgomery, and Anderson-Cook 2016)</span>. The interaction among the input variables and parameters is called a design space <span class="citation" data-cites="bastogne2017qbd">(Bastogne 2017)</span>.

<p>Designs are adopted based on the objective of the sensory experiments. If the objective is comparison between two products, paired comparison or group comparison designs could be used. If there are more than two combinations of ingredients and one has to choose the best combination, CRD or RCBD could be used. When the number of treatments is larger, BIBD can be used. When different factors are varied in different levels to make various combinations, factorial experiments are conducted. Response surface designs are used for product optimisation. Response surface graphs helps in understanding the effects of variables on responses much easily. For pairwise and groupwise comparison designs, a t test or Mann Whitney U test can be performed for analysis. For designs with more than two treatments ANOVA or Kruskal Wallis test can be used. For analysis of nominal data chi square test or Thurstonian models are used.</p>

<h2 data-number="1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>Survey research is a widely used method for collecting quantitative data on human behaviour, attitudes, and opinions. The accuracy of insights derived from surveys largely depends on the quality of the instruments used, particularly the validity and reliability of questionnaires <span class="citation" data-cites="carmines1979reliability cronbach1951alpha">(Carmines and Zeller 1979; Cronbach 1951)</span>. Validity ensures that a questionnaire measures the intended construct, while reliability indicates the consistency of measurements over time.</p>
<p>However, assessing these psychometric properties can be challenging, as traditional methods often involve manual calculations or specialised statistical software that may not be readily accessible to all researchers <span class="citation" data-cites="pallant2020spss">(Pallant 2020)</span>. To address this limitation, a user-friendly web application was developed to automate validity and reliability testing, providing real-time feedback through an intuitive interface <span class="citation" data-cites="kline2023sem">(Kline 2023)</span> This innovation enables researchers to perform comprehensive psychometric evaluations efficiently, regardless of their statistical expertise.</p>
<p>In applied research contexts such as agriculture, questionnaires are among the most commonly used tools, yet many studies fail to report procedures for assessing validity (31%) and reliability (33%) <span class="citation" data-cites="radhakrishna2007questionnaire">(Radhakrishna 2007)</span>. By automating these assessments, the developed web application reduces measurement errors-such as sampling, selection, and frame errors-thereby improving the precision and consistency of data collection <span class="citation" data-cites="singh2017questionnaire">(Singh 2017)</span>.</p>
<p>Overall, the web application enhances the methodological rigour of survey research by simplifying complex statistical evaluations, empowering researchers to design reliable and valid instruments, and strengthening the credibility of research outcomes. Its adoption can significantly improve research quality, particularly in developing regions where expertise in psychometric analysis is often limited.</p>

<section id="reliability" class="level3" data-number="2.1">
<h3 data-number="2.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reliability"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Reliability</h3>
<p>Reliability ensures the consistency and stability of a measurement tool, producing similar results under identical conditions <span class="citation" data-cites="nunnally1994psychometric">(Nunnally and Bernstein 1994)</span>. It underpins the credibility of research by confirming that findings reflect true phenomena rather than measurement errors. Figure&nbsp;1 categorises reliability into four types: Test-retest, Parallel-form, Interrater, and Internal consistency. Each type includes specific methods such as Pearson Correlation, ICC, Cohen’s Kappa, and Cronbach’s Alpha for assessing consistency. They ensure measurement stability, agreement, and internal accuracy across tests and raters.</p>
<p>Assessing reliability often requires complex statistical calculations and multiple software tools, making it challenging for researchers without strong statistical expertise. Interpreting results like ICC, Cronbach’s Alpha, or Cohen’s Kappa can also be confusing and time-consuming. To overcome these difficulties, this web application was developed to provide an integrated, user-friendly platform that automates reliability testing and simplifies result interpretation.</p>

<section id="validity" class="level3" data-number="2.2">
<h3 data-number="2.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="validity"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Validity</h3>
<p>Validity testing ensures that research instruments accurately measure the intended constructs, enhancing the credibility and quality of findings <span class="citation" data-cites="cronbach1955construct">(Cronbach and Meehl 1955)</span>. It minimises measurement errors, strengthens reliability, and supports the generalization of results to broader contexts. Using valid tools ensures ethical responsibility, as accurate data lead to meaningful scientific contributions and sound decision-making in applied fields. Validity testing also refines instruments by confirming that each item measures only its intended construct, thereby advancing reliable and theory-based research.</p>
<p>Figure&nbsp;2 classifies validity into Content, Construct, Criterion, and Face Validity. Each type uses specific methods like EFA, CFA, Correlation Analysis, and Expert Review to ensure instruments measure intended constructs accurately. Together, these tests strengthen measurement accuracy, relevance, and scientific credibility.</p>
<p>Testing validity involves complex statistical methods like EFA, CFA, and correlation analyses, which require advanced statistical knowledge and multiple software tools. Interpreting these results can be time-consuming and confusing for non-experts. To overcome these challenges, this web application was developed to integrate all validity tests into one user-friendly platform, automating analysis and simplifying result interpretation.</p>

<h2 data-number="4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="user-gratification-test"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> User Gratification Test</h2>
<p>To evaluate the developed web application, user gratification was employed as the primary testing construct. User gratification, drawn from psychology and consumer behaviour theories, reflects the satisfaction users experience when interacting with a system <span class="citation" data-cites="ruggiero2000gratifications">(Ruggiero 2000)</span>. It provides a holistic framework that incorporates both functional and hedonic dimensions of user experience.</p>
<p>For academic research platforms, gratification is shaped by factors such as ease of use <span class="citation" data-cites="davis1989tam">(Davis 1989)</span>, trust in results <span class="citation" data-cites="gefen2011sem">(Gefen, Rigdon, and Straub 2011)</span>, aesthetic appeal <span class="citation" data-cites="blythe2003funology">(Blythe and Hassenzahl 2003)</span>, and the extent to which the system meets user requirements. Accordingly, the application was tested across these dimensions to determine its effectiveness in supporting research activities.</p>
<p>A total of 30 participants were selected using convenience sampling, comprising postgraduate students and researchers in agricultural sciences. User gratification was measured using a 5-point Likert scale (1 = Strongly Disagree to 5 = Strongly Agree). The constructs included Technology (2 items), Hedonic (2 items), Risk (2 items), and Behavioural Intention (1 item).</p>
<p>The functional aspects of gratification were assessed by examining accuracy, efficiency, and automation in validity and reliability testing. These features reduce manual effort and save time, directly contributing to user satisfaction. The hedonic aspects, including enjoyment, interactivity, and engagement <span class="citation" data-cites="venkatesh2008tam3">(Venkatesh and Bala 2008)</span>, were also measured, recognising their role in transforming data analysis into a more engaging process.</p>
<p>Specific indicators such as convenience, authenticity of results, user engagement, privacy concerns, and behavioural intentions were incorporated into the evaluation. This ensured that both the technical performance and psychological impact of the system were captured. By adopting user gratification as a testing framework, the study provides insights into how well the application fulfils user expectations and promotes its continued use in academic research.</p>

<p>The reliability of the user gratification construct was evaluated using Cronbach’s Alpha. Table&nbsp;1 presents the results for the four key dimensions: technology (convenience), hedonic (enjoyment), risk (privacy concern), and behavioural intention.</p>
<p>All four dimensions demonstrated strong internal consistency. Technology (convenience) showed good reliability (α = 0.80), while hedonic (enjoyment) also indicated good reliability (α = 0.89). Risk (privacy concern) achieved the highest reliability (α = 0.97), reflecting excellent consistency. Behavioral intention was similarly reliable (α = 0.91). The overall scale demonstrated high internal consistency, with Cronbach’s α = 0.91, which is considered acceptable for research instruments.</p>

<p>An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted to examine the dimensionality of the user gratification construct for the web application. Factor loadings are presented in Table&nbsp;2. Items with loadings above 0.60 were retained as acceptable indicators of their respective factors.</p>
<p>The results indicate strong item loadings across most constructs, with the majority exceeding the recommended threshold of 0.70, confirming convergent validity. The Technology (Authenticity of Conversation) factor showed particularly high loadings (α &gt; 0.81 to 0.92), reflecting the natural and human-like interaction experience provided by the chatbot. Hedonic (Enjoyment) and Hedonic (Pass Time) dimensions also demonstrated high loadings (ranging from 0.76 to 0.91), highlighting the engaging and enjoyable aspects of the application.</p>
<p>Risk-related factors were also significant. Privacy Concerns had high loadings (0.85–0.93), showing that users remain cautious about data security. Similarly, Immature Technology loadings (0.84–0.95) suggested some limitations in system accuracy and responsiveness. Behavioral intention showed relatively lower loadings (0.58–0.75), but still indicated a positive tendency toward future use and recommendation of the chatbot.</p>
<p>These findings confirm that the web application provides gratification both functionally (convenience, authenticity) and hedonically (enjoyment, pass time), while also highlighting areas of concern regarding privacy and system maturity.</p>

<p>A multiple regression analysis was conducted to examine the influence of six predictors: Technology Convenience, Technology Authenticity, Hedonic Enjoyment, Hedonic Pass Time, Risk Privacy, and Risk Immature Technology-on Behavioural Intention.</p>
<p>The regression model was statistically significant, F(6,24) = 8.07, p &lt; 0.001, indicating that the predictors collectively explained a substantial portion of the variance in Behavioural Intention. The model accounted for 66.9% of the variance (R² = 0.669; Adjusted R² = 0.586). Among the predictors, Technology Authenticity (β = 0.641, p = 0.015) and Hedonic Pass Time (β = 0.421, p = 0.024) had significant positive effects on Behavioural Intention. This suggests that participants who perceived the web application as authentic and those who used it as a meaningful way to pass time were more likely to express stronger behavioural intention to use it. Technology Convenience (β = 0.256, p = 0.082) showed a positive but only marginally significant effect (p &lt; 0.10). Hedonic Enjoyment (β = 0.273, p = 0.412), Risk Privacy (β = 0.031, p = 0.632), and Risk Immature Technology (β = -0.066, p = 0.365) were not significant predictors of Behavioural Intention.

<h2 data-number="1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>In the post-globalization era, many countries witnessed high momentum in economic growth. However, this rapid growth failed to provide the much-needed ‘trickle-down’ effect at the expected rate. The unequal growth of different sectors exacerbated poverty and income inequality. Generally, poor people adopt various livelihood strategies such as smallholder entrepreneurship, participation in agricultural and non-farm labour markets, and migration to overcome poverty <span class="citation" data-cites="worldbank2007report">(World Bank 2007)</span>. The decision to adopt particular strategies is influenced by access to resources and gender power relations within the community and household.</p>
<p>In recent decades, the Indian agriculture sector has experienced a high level of feminization, accelerating rapidly. The poverty-induced shift of the male population from farm to non-farm activities for sustenance and better income is quite evident in the country’s economy <span class="citation" data-cites="itishree2018feminization">(Itishree et al. 2018)</span>. Therefore, providing credit and other input facilities to women is considered an important policy intervention for poverty alleviation and agricultural development in the country.</p>
<p>Financial inclusion—bringing all sections of society, regardless of socio-economic status, into the formal financial system—plays a pivotal role in any nation’s holistic development. The inclusion of marginalized sections of society in formal financial institutions is a critical prerequisite for eradicating poverty and fostering economic growth <span class="citation" data-cites="demirguckunt2008finance rangarajan2008report">(Demirguc-Kunt, Levine, and Detragiache 2008; Rangarajan 2008)</span>. Various studies have pointed out that countries with higher levels of financial inclusion exhibit better GDP growth rates <span class="citation" data-cites="demirguckunt2009finance">(Demirguc-Kunt and Levine 2009)</span>.</p>
<p>The microfinance movement has played a crucial role in addressing this national issue and has emerged as the single largest saviour of the rural poor from financial exclusion, especially for women. Among the different models, the Self-Help Group (SHG)-led microfinance model has evolved into the most prominent channel for financial inclusion and has become an integral and inevitable component of the rural economy in India <span class="citation" data-cites="dhar2016microfinance">(Dhar 2016)</span>. Ideally, poor people can invest small amounts in micro-enterprises to generate income for their livelihood. SHGs have been financing both income-generating and consumption-related needs of members. However, various studies have shown that earlier credit requirements were often used for consumption purposes <span class="citation" data-cites="sooryamoorthy2007microcredit vasantha2014challenges">(Sooryamoorthy 2007; Vasantha 2014)</span>.</p>
<p>Among income-generating activities, dairy enterprises are especially popular among farmers due to their familiarity with dairying and the opportunity for year-round cash flow, which facilitates easy loan repayment. The performance of SHGs in southern Indian states has been commendable in terms of loan repayment rates and the velocity of lending. In particular, the SHG movement in Kerala has gained significant attention due to its active role in the state’s poverty eradication programmes. A study on women’s participation in agriculture and allied activities found that over 95% of the work in the animal husbandry sector in rural Kerala was performed by women <span class="citation" data-cites="geethakutty2014impact">(Geethakutty et al. 2014)</span>. Furthermore, refinancing of dairy loans shows a positive trend and holds vast potential for enhancing the employment and income of poor households, especially women <span class="citation" data-cites="nabard2019status">(NABARD 2019)</span>.</p>
<p>The factors affecting the repayment performance of SHGs require thorough investigation, as they depend on multiple socioeconomic variables. Since only a limited number of empirical studies have examined the influence of such factors in India, this paper explores the group performance of SHGs and investigates the determinants of their repayment behaviour.</p>

<h2 data-number="2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="materials-and-methods"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Materials and methods</h2>
<p>The SHG movement in the study state, Kerala, began with the Kudumbashree Mission, which was implemented two decades ago with strong support from the state government. This study made use of both primary and secondary data. The secondary data regarding the dairy based SHG’s were collected from the State Poverty Eradication Mission of the Government of Kerala and also from its district offices. The primary data were collected from both SHG members and non-members during the period 2020–21.</p>
<p>In accordance with the objectives, a multistage random sampling technique was adopted. The high-altitude agro-economic zone was purposively selected due to the presence of a large number of dairy-financed SHGs in the area. From this zone, Idukki and Wayanad districts were selected purposively, as they are predominantly rural and host the highest number of dairy-financed SHGs.</p>
<p>Further, two blocks each were randomly selected from these districts: Nedumkandam and Adimaly from Idukki, and Mananthavady and Kalpetta from Wayanad. Only groups that had availed of dairy loans and had a minimum of three years of experience were included in the sample, based on the assumption that benefits of SHG participation would be meaningfully reflected over that time. From each selected block, 20 women SHGs were randomly chosen, resulting in a total sample of 80 groups.</p>
<p>Data on group performance—such as frequency of meetings, planned savings, transaction costs incurred, savings accumulated, interest rate charged, bank linkage loans availed, repayment schedule, income-generating activities financed, group size, financial inclusion status, and socio-economic profile of members—were collected through interviews with SHG leaders and inspection of register books.</p>
<p>Loan performance was assessed using both internal and external loan indicators, considering the average of the past two years. Intragroup lending performance was measured by the percentage of members who received internal loans annually. Repayment performance was assessed by the ratio of the amount repaid to the amount due (credit plus interest), separately for internal group loans (from group savings) and external bank linkage loans (from formal financial institutions).</p>
<p>The key performance indicators were calculated as follows:</p>
<p><span id="eq-eq1"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctext%7BSaving%20performance%7D%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Ctext%7BActual%20Savings%7D%7D%7B%5Ctext%7BPlanned%20Savings%7D%7D%20%5Ctag%7B1%7D"></span></p>

<p>The delinquency rate was used as a proxy for repayment performance and was computed using Equation&nbsp;3.</p>
<p><span id="eq-eq3"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctext%7BDelinquency%20rate%7D%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Ctext%7BVolume%20of%20Loans%20in%20Arrears%7D%7D%7B%5Ctext%7BTotal%20Loan%20Volume%20on%20Promised%20Date%7D%7D%20%5Ctag%7B3%7D"></span></p>
<p>A delinquency rate of 0 indicates complete repayment on schedule, while a value of 1 indicates complete delinquency. This measure follows the approach suggested by <span class="citation" data-cites="sharma1997repayment">(Sharma and Zeller 1997)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="feroze2011factors">(Feroze et al. 2011)</span>.</p>
<p>The factors affecting the delinquency rate were estimated using the Tobit maximum likelihood estimation technique, considering the censored nature of the dependent variable.</p>

<p>The saving performance of groups was evaluated by comparing the planned savings amount with the actual savings amount. The pre-decided/agreed amount of savings in respective groups was considered as planned savings amount. The details of category wise saving performance are elaborated in Table&nbsp;3. From Table&nbsp;3, it is well observable that average cumulative savings per member was Rs.19803 in the overall category and it varied from Rs.13161 of IMG category to Rs. 26040 of the LMG category. The average planned savings per group was worked out as Rs. 306812 over the years and the average achievement in the targeted amount was found to be Rs.295593. The savings performance ratio in the overall category was found to be 0.9665, which implies that 96.65 per cent achievement in the pre-planned amount. The high saving ratio of the selected SHGs showed a better level of financial decorum maintained by the groups in savings amount accumulation. The improved economic background of the state and livelihood options provided through microfinance activities could be the possible reason for the high saving performance in the study area. In contrast, the saving ratio reported by the other studies was quite low and it ranges from 71 per cent to 74 per cent only <span class="citation" data-cites="verhelle2003determinants feroze2010performance">(Verhelle and Berlage 2003; Feroze and Chauhan 2010)</span>. The detailed analysis across different age group categories showed that the saving performance of initial matured groups (98.11%) was relatively higher than the elder category groups. The divergence in the savings amount was observed in some groups mainly because of the adjustments of group savings to the outstanding loan arrears. The trend was observed more in elder category groups than younger ones. Such undesirable practices may affect the self-sustainability of groups in the long run.</p>

<p>The SHGs has been offering two types of loaning facility to its members, i.e., internal group loan and the external bank linkage loan. Even though the external bank linkage loan was taken in the name of generating productive purposes, its utilization was found to be diverted from the intended objectives. The utilization of external bank linkage loans across different portfolios is detailed in Table&nbsp;4. It could be seen from Table&nbsp;4 that 24.85 per cent of the availed loan was utilized for agricultural and allied activities and 10.58 per cent for the business purposes. The remaining 64.57 per cent of the loan availed was utilized for different consumption purposes. Among that loans, the maximum proportion of the loan was availed for meeting the requirements of children’s education (19.90%) followed by medical expenses (16.12%), household expenses (14.36%), and marriage and festival expenses (8.31%), respectively. The observations of the study found consistent with the findings of <span class="citation" data-cites="kumar2013access">(Kumar 2013)</span>, in which he reported that 70 per cent of the availed SHG loan was utilized for personal consumption purposes rather than financing income generation activities in Kerala.</p>

<p>The internal loaning performance of the group was captured through the percentage of members who received an internal loan per annum by considering the past two years’ loan distribution mechanism (Table&nbsp;5). On average, groups were capable of disbursing internal loans amounting to Rs. 370099 per annum in the study area. Among them, the long-matured groups’ loan magnitude was distinctly high, at Rs. 465506 per annum, due to the larger corpus fund availability. The tenure of establishment also influenced the magnitude of loan per member, which varied from Rs. 18100 to Rs. 31123 across different age group categories, with an overall average of Rs. 24844 per annum. The outreach of internal loans was found to be 95.24 per cent in the initially matured groups and increased to 99.32 per cent in elder (LMG) groups, with an overall average of 97.32 per cent. The analysis of internal loaning performance implies that the groups in the area were able to distribute their thrift money in a well-equitable manner.</p>
<p>The SHGs were availing loans from formal financial institutions to meet members’ extra financial requirements. The grading of groups was a mandatory criterion followed by the banks for the approval of bank linkage loans. The loan application from each group went through a three-level monitoring mechanism of the Kudumbashree Mission—namely, the Area Development Societies (ADS) committee at the panchayat ward level and the Community Development Society (CDS) committee at the panchayat level—for scrutiny. A recommendation letter from the CDS chairperson was a mandatory document for availing the bank linkage loan for SHGs. Such high-level scrutiny also helped banks assess the repayment capacity of each group.</p>
<p>The bank charged compound interest as per prevailing lending norms, which ranged from 11 to 13 per cent, based on the loan amount and the repayment duration chosen by the group. However, the groups were eligible for an interest subsidy of up to 7 per cent under the National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) interest subvention scheme. An additional 3 per cent interest subvention was provided by the state government to all Women SHGs (WSHGs) in the state.</p>
<p>The study observed that out of the total 80 groups, 4 groups (5%) had not availed any kind of bank credit in the past two years. The lack of consensus among members and risk-averse behaviour of these groups was reported as the reason, despite all groups having accessed at least one bank linkage since their inception. A maximum of eight linkages was observed among the selected SHGs. The processing time for loan applications was reported to be less than one month in the study area, and the repayment period of term loans varied from 3 to 5 years, depending on the loan amount.</p>

<p>The average bank linkage loan amount was found highest in long matured groups (Rs. 614545) followed by the MMG (Rs. 545536) and IMG (Rs. 417217) category, respectively. The credit-thrift ratio of the availed loans was computed to be 2.22:1, 1.75:1, and 1.57:1 in IMG, MMG, and LMG categories, respectively. The recently formed groups have a lesser amount of thrift and a huge demand for working capital, which could be the possible reason for the higher credit-thrift ratio in the IMG category. The credit–thrift ratio of SHG linkage loans reported by different studies varied from 1.4:1 to 6:1 <span class="citation" data-cites="satyasai2014whither verhelle2003determinants feroze2010performance">(Satyasai, Sahoo, and Smita 2014; Verhelle and Berlage 2003; Feroze and Chauhan 2010)</span>. The ratio in the elder groups was not found impressive; this was due to the ceiling on lending (Rs. 10 lakhs/group) fixed by the banks and also possibly due to the availability of high corpus funds with these groups.</p>
<p>The repayment period of internal loans varied from three months to two years in the selected SHGs. The interest rate of the internal loan has been decided as per the groups’ consensus and is being collected monthly. In the study area, the groups were charging 12 per cent simple interest for the internal group loan, i.e., 1 per cent per month. The demand for internal loans is high because of ease of availability, flexibility in the repayment schedule, and attractiveness in the interest rate. The maximum individual lending limit of the internal loan is updated based on the corpus fund availability and members’ demand. It was observed that the maximum lending limit of the internal loan amount ranged from Rs. 20000 to Rs. 75000 per member in the selected groups.</p>

<p>Furtherly, the repayment performance of the group was evaluated through the amount of loan repaid on the scheduled time. Although the SHGs nominally fixed the installment amount for monthly repayments, in practice, members repay their loans without any fixed installment schedule. The average repayment rate (Table&nbsp;6) of the internal loan was found to be 87.81 per cent, 87.16 per cent, and 84.62 per cent in initial, medium, and long matured category groups, respectively, with an overall average of 86.72 per cent. The category-wise analysis indicated that the delinquency rate was high in the case of the LMG category compared to the younger groups. These findings were in line with the observations of <span class="citation" data-cites="nedumaran2001impact feroze2011factors apmas2017impact">(Nedumaran, Palanisami, and Swaminathan 2001; Feroze et al. 2011; APMAS 2017)</span>, where they reported that repayment of internal group loans faces more challenges than repayment of external bank linkage loans. The utilization of loans for consumption purposes and flexibility in the loan repayment might be the plausible reason for the poor repayment rate of internal group loans in the study area. Besides that, the monitoring agencies of the SHGs were more concerned about the prompt repayment of the external loan amount and least bothered about the overall repayment scenario of the groups.</p>
<p>The SHGs have been keeping separate accounts for external bank linkage loans. It was observed that the groups in the study area were not charging any extra commission for the external bank linkage loan from its members. The availed bank loan amount has been distributed within the group as per the members’ requirement. The disbursed amount varied from Rs. 15000 to Rs. 100000 per member in the sampled SHGs as per the members’ requirements. The analysis of external loan repayment revealed that the repayment rate of the bank linkage loan was quite impressive in the sampled SHGs, with an overall average of 99.24 per cent. Out of the total 80 SHGs, only 7 SHGs were facing some level of challenges in the prompt loan repayment. The groups were eligible for the back-end subsidy for prompt loan repayment, which motivates the members for timely repayment. Moreover, the banks were more stringent in penalizing defaulters, which increases the burden on all the members and automatically creates peer pressure.</p>
<p>The opening of individual savings bank accounts has been considered a prerequisite for the economic empowerment of women <span class="citation" data-cites="satyasai2014whither">(Satyasai, Sahoo, and Smita 2014)</span>. The role of SHGs in the financial inclusion of members was also captured through the savings bank account penetration ratio (SBAP), i.e., the proportion of members having an individual savings bank account to the total. On average, more than 90 per cent of the group members had their own individual savings bank account in the selected SHGs. The highest SBAP ratio was observed in the LMG (96.04%) category, followed by MMG and IMG category groups. The financial literacy earned through SHG activities motivates the members to open individual bank accounts in large numbers.</p>

<p>Prompt loan repayment is an imperative factor that determines the financial sustainability of any microfinance initiatives. From the earlier economic performance analysis, it was observed that the repayment of the external bank linkage loans was quite impressive in the study area. However, the prompt repayment of internal loans lacking momentum. Thus, the factors affecting the repayment behaviour of internal group loans have captured through TOBIT censored regression model to identify the determinants of prompt loan repayment by taking the delinquency rate as a dependent variable. The sample mean of the different explanatory variables used in the model is detailed in Table&nbsp;7. The average delinquency rate was worked out to be 13.28 per cent and varied from zero (complete repayment) to 24.20 per cent in the selected SHGs.</p>

<p>The proper monitoring mechanism reduces the incidence of wilful default and enhances the group’s ability to collect debt in time. The number of group meetings held per annum was taken as a proxy for capturing the groups’ monitoring ability. Group meetings provide an opportunity to monitor the repayment performance of its members. In general, meetings were convened in members’ homes on a rotation basis. The average number of meetings conducted per annum was found to be 49.28 in the study area and ranged from 44 to 52 meetings per annum.</p>
<p>The variable peer pressure was captured through a dummy variable. It was observed that only 37 groups (46.25%) were exerting such kind of pressure on the group members for prompt loan repayment. Further, the self-selected groups have better understandings of their members, and the study assumed that it may lead to prompt loan repayment. The main screening of members occurred in the post group formation period. Therefore, both ex-ante and ex-post factors were considered for measuring the degree of self-selection <span class="citation" data-cites="wydick1999social">(Wydick 1999)</span>.</p>
<p>The intensity of self-selection was captured through the scale developing technique. It was set as a four-digit scale where each positive answer gets one point to assess the intensity of self-selection. The sum of four different indicators—whether groups were formed by voluntary consensus of all the members, whether members were dropped out on group law violations, whether groups explicitly decided to reject new applicants, and whether new members had joined in the post-inception period—were considered for scale development <span class="citation" data-cites="verhelle2003determinants feroze2011factors">(Verhelle and Berlage 2003; Feroze et al. 2011)</span>.</p>
<p>Out of the total 80 SHGs, 74 groups (92.50%) reported that they formed the group voluntarily without any external agency involvement. The number of groups that rejected the request of a new applicant was found to be 23 (28.75%), and 68 groups (85.00%) added new members even after the inception of the group. Only 9 groups (11.25%) reported member exclusion for violating the decorum of the group. The reasons for exclusion varied from poor attendance in group meetings to non-deposit of weekly savings contributions. The average self-selection score in the selected SHGs was found to be 2.18.</p>
<p>The homogeneity in the group was measured by considering different socio-economic characteristics of group members. The scale consists of six indicators: age, religion, education, occupation, landholding size, and marital status. One point was given for each of the following: whether the age range of members was less than 15 years, whether 80% of members belonged to the same religion, had the same marital status, same educational level, same income-earning activity, and similar landholding sizes <span class="citation" data-cites="verhelle2003determinants">(Verhelle and Berlage 2003)</span>.</p>
<p>The highest number of groups (71 SHGs) were homogeneous in marital status (87.5%). A total of 39 groups (48.75%) reported age difference among members within 15 years, and 42 groups (52.50%) reported homogeneity in educational status. About 50 groups (62.5%) reported homogeneity in occupational status, and 63 groups (78.75%) were homogeneous in landholding size. The lowest homogeneity was observed in religion, where only 15 groups (18.75%) were homogeneous. The homogeneity score in the selected groups varied from 2 to 5, with an average of 3.6.</p>
<p>Smaller groups tend to have better in-group coordination and control, reducing problems from asymmetric information <span class="citation" data-cites="ghatak1999economics">(Ghatak and Guinnane 1999)</span>. Thus, it was expected that smaller group size would lead to lower default. The number of members in the selected SHGs ranged from 11 to 20, with an average of 15.16 members.</p>
<p>The average number of children directly dependent on the group members was also considered to analyze its role in repayment. The mean dependency ratio was 1.84 and ranged from 1.16 to 2.35 children per member per group.</p>
<p>Groups fixed a maximum individual loan lending limit based on consensus. A higher loan limit may increase the likelihood of unwilling default. The individual loan limit was used as a proxy for this factor. It varied from Rs.20,000 to Rs.75,000 per member, with an overall average of Rs.43,360.</p>
<p>The tenure of group establishment was considered to analyze the role of experience in repayment. Older groups may better understand the repayment capacity of members based on past experience. The average group age was 127 months, ranging from 40 to 228 months in the selected SHGs.</p>

<p>The estimated coefficients can alternatively be interpreted as the determinants of prompt loan repayment. From the estimated model (Table&nbsp;8), it was found that peer pressure, homogeneity of the group, mean dependency ratio, and the amount of loan disbursed were the key factors influencing prompt loan repayment in the study area.</p>

<p>Contrary to the earlier assumption, the coefficient of homogeneity was found to be positive and significant at the 1 per cent level. This implies that the homogeneity of the groups raises the chance for wilful default. In socially homogeneous groups, individuals strongly rely on the peer’s unconditional support and are thus more likely to ride free, which causes prolonged time for loan repayment.</p>
<p>As expected, peer pressure had a negative association with the delinquency rate. The groups that exerted pressure on their members by implementing strict rules and penalties for late repayment demonstrated better repayment performance.</p>
<p>The coefficient of the loan amount was found to be positive and significant at the 5 per cent level. The majority of members depended on agriculture and allied activities for their livelihood and followed a ‘balloon repayment schedule’ in the study area. The pronounced seasonality of farming income compelled members to delay timely repayment of internal loans, which were less penalized compared to external bank loans. Similar observations were made by <span class="citation" data-cites="khandker2017seasonality">(Khandker, Samad, and Badruddoza 2017)</span> from their Bangladesh-based study on microfinance institutions.</p>
<p>The coefficient of dependency ratio was found to be negative and significant in the estimated model. Groups with a higher dependency ratio showed better loan repayment performance, which contradicts earlier expectations.</p>
<p>Even though the other variables were not statistically significant, they exhibited interesting relationships with the delinquency rate. The coefficient of peer monitoring was negative, indicating that a higher number of meetings per year has a positive influence on prompt loan repayment.</p>
<p>Contrary to prior assumptions, the group size variable turned negative, indicating that larger groups had better repayment rates than smaller groups. The positive coefficient of the degree of self-selection suggests that groups with a high degree of self-selection were more prone to wilful default.</p>
<p>Lastly, the positive coefficient of group establishment tenure indicates that the tendency for delayed repayment was higher among elder groups compared to younger ones. Elder groups were more lenient with their repayment schedules, and many did not impose penalties for irregular payments, which eventually contributed to higher delinquency.</p>

<p>The study provides insights into the financial behaviour of dairy-based SHGs in Kerala, with specific focus on internal loan repayment performance and its determinants. The overall loaning performance showed encouraging trends, particularly with respect to the external bank linkage loans, which recorded a high repayment rate of 99.24 per cent. In contrast, internal loans exhibited relatively lower repayment rates, with an average of 86.72 per cent, highlighting a crucial area for improvement. The Tobit regression analysis identified peer pressure, group homogeneity, dependency ratio, and loan amount as significant predictors of delinquency. Peer pressure had a significant negative relationship with delinquency, reinforcing the notion that groups which enforce rules and repayment discipline are more successful in maintaining financial decorum. Interestingly, homogeneity showed a positive and significant effect on delinquency, which contradicts conventional expectations. This suggests that in highly homogeneous groups, social closeness may undermine financial accountability due to overreliance on peer leniency. A similar counterintuitive result was observed with the dependency ratio, where groups with more dependents showed better repayment rates—possibly due to heightened financial responsibility and urgency among members with larger families.</p>
<p>The positive association of loan amount with delinquency reflects the challenges of repayment under seasonal income patterns common in agriculture. Members following balloon repayment schedules were often unable to meet instalments on time, especially in the absence of strong penalties for internal loans. Although other factors like peer monitoring, group size, and selfselection were not statistically significant, their coefficients indicated meaningful directions: more frequent meetings and larger group size were associated with lower delinquency, while greater self-selection surprisingly hinted at more wilful default. Overall, the findings highlight that internal governance, socio-economic dynamics, and institutional design within SHGs substantially influence repayment behaviour. Strengthening peer accountability, revisiting group norms on loan penalties, and promoting financial literacy can enhance the sustainability of internal lending systems within SHGs.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The present study demonstrates that SHG-based microfinance has the potential to mobilize small savings from poor households while serving as an effective tool for the financial inclusion of women. The saving performance of the groups and the repayment of external bank linkage loans were found to be highly satisfactory in the study area. The integration of dairy activities—known for their ability to provide year-round income—has further supported the members in actively participating in microfinance initiatives. It was observed that a significant portion of group loans was utilized for consumption purposes, particularly for children’s education and medical expenses. Despite this, the repayment performance of external bank loans remained strong, indicating the effective functioning of dairy-based SHGs in rural areas. These groups have played a critical role in enhancing the economic resilience of poor households, especially women, by enabling them to manage their livelihoods more sustainably. Moreover, the experience gained through SHG participation has contributed to improved financial literacy among members. The findings of the study reaffirm the role of SHGs not only as credit providers but also as catalysts for promoting inclusive finance and empowering marginalized communities.</p>

<p>Sesame (<em>Sesamum indicum</em> L., 2n=2x=26) represents one of humanity’s most ancient cultivated oilseed crops, with archaeological evidence suggesting its cultivation dates back over 4,000 years <span class="citation" data-cites="bedigian2015systematics">(Bedigian 2015)</span>. Known by various vernacular names including Gingelly, Ellu in Malayalam, and Tila in Sanskrit, this crop holds profound cultural and religious significance, particularly in Indian traditions where sesame seeds feature prominently in Hindu religious ceremonies <span class="citation" data-cites="wei2015genetic">(Wei et al. 2015)</span>. The ancient Sanskrit etymology supports the hypothesis that sesame may have been the source of the first extracted vegetable oil, underlining its historical importance in human nutrition <span class="citation" data-cites="pathak2014value">(Pathak et al. 2014)</span>. Modern nutritional analysis reveals that sesame seeds contain 50–60% oil of exceptional quality, comparable to olive oil in its nutritional profile <span class="citation" data-cites="uzun2008variation anilakumar2010nutritional">(Uzun, Yol, and Furat 2008; Anilakumar et al. 2010)</span>.</p>
<p>Sesame oil demonstrates remarkable stability compared to other edible oils, primarily attributed to its rich content of natural antioxidants including sesamin, sesaminol, sesamol, sesamolinol, and squalene <span class="citation" data-cites="namiki2007nutraceutical kamaleldin2011sesame">(Namiki 2007; Kamal-Eldin, Moazzami, and Washi 2011)</span>. The oil’s high concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids, combined with its cholesterol-lowering and blood pressure-reducing properties, has renewed scientific and commercial interest in this ancient crop <span class="citation" data-cites="sankar2006pilot gouveia2014effects dalibalta2020health">(Sankar et al. 2006; Gouveia et al. 2014; Dalibalta, Majdalawieh, and Manjikian 2020)</span>.</p>
<p>Recent genomic studies have revealed the complex genetic architecture underlying sesame’s agronomic traits, with high-throughput sequencing technologies enabling the identification of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with yield components and stress tolerance <span class="citation" data-cites="zhang2013genetic wang2016genome yu2019pmdbase">(Zhang et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2016; Yu et al. 2019)</span>.

<p>Despite its nutritional superiority and agricultural advantages—including drought tolerance, low input requirements, and suitability for crop rotations due to its extensive taproot system <span class="citation" data-cites="ashri2007sesame">(Ashri 2007)</span>—sesame productivity remains disappointingly low. India, while leading globally in both cultivation area (1.8 million hectares) and production (0.87 million tonnes), achieves an average productivity of only 483 kg/ha, significantly below China (1,200 kg/ha) and Turkey (1,100 kg/ha) <span class="citation" data-cites="fao2020faostat yahaya2021genetic">(FAO 2020; Yahaya et al. 2021)</span>.</p>

<p>The experiment was conducted during October 2007 to February 2008 at the Department of Plant Breeding and Genetics, College of Horticulture, Vellanikkara. Seeds were sown in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Plot dimensions maintained a spacing of 45 cm between rows and 20 cm between plants, following standard agronomic practices for the region.Observations were recorded on ten randomly tagged plants per genotype for nine quantitative characters: days to flowering, plant height (cm), number of branches per plant, number of capsules per plant, capsule length (cm), number of locules per capsule, 1000-seed weight (g), seed yield per plant (g), and oil content (%).</p>

<p>Considerable variation was observed across all studied traits. Days to flowering ranged from 18.73 days (KYM-1) to 34.8 days (Tilarani) with a mean of 27.35 days. Plant height showed extensive variation from 31.40 cm (IVTS-06-12) to 107.97 cm (Soma), averaging 53.44 cm. Seed yield per plant, the most variable trait, ranged from 1.35g (IVTS-06-22) to 7.02g (SVPR-1) with a mean of 3.47g.<br>
The genetic parameters for the traits studied as a part of the experiment are presented in Table&nbsp;3.</p>
<p>Number of branches per plant (51.83%) and capsules per plant (43.56%) show the highest variability, indicating excellent prospects for selection and breeding. Low variability in 1000-seed weight (2.95%) suggests this trait is more genetically stable across genotypes.</p>
<p>All traits exhibited high broad-sense heritability exceeding 85%. The highest heritability was observed for locules per capsule (100%) followed by plant height (99.75%), seed yield per plant (98.69%), and number of capsules per plant (98.34%).</p>
<p>The significant genetic variation observed across all studied traits provides a robust foundation for sesame breeding programs. High heritability estimates (&gt;85%) for all traits indicate that observed phenotypic variation primarily reflects genetic differences rather than environmental effects, facilitating effective selection strategies <span class="citation" data-cites="allard1960principles kumar2016genetic">(Allard 1960; H. Kumar and Garg 2016)</span>. The combination of high heritability with high genetic advance for days to flowering, plant height, number of branches per plant, number of capsules per plant, and seed yield per plant suggests predominant additive gene action, making these traits responsive to simple selection methods <span class="citation" data-cites="burton1952quantitative singh2006biometrical">(Burton 1952; A.

<p>Path analysis as depicted in Table&nbsp;5 revealed that number of capsules per plant exerted the highest positive direct effect (1.106) on seed yield per plant, followed by capsule length (0.106), plant height (0.077), and 1000-seed weight (0.022). Conversely, number of branches per plant showed the highest negative direct effect (-0.231), followed by days to flowering (-0.108) and oil content (-0.020). The residual effect was 0.203, indicating that approximately 80% of variation in seed yield was explained by the studied traits. The negative direct effect of branches per plant (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?-0.231">) despite positive correlation suggests indirect benefits through increased capsule production. Plant height contributes mainly through indirect effects via capsule production. The analysis explains 79.66% of yield variation, indicating good model adequacy.</p>

<p>The clustering of genotypes from the same geographical origin into different groups confirms that genetic drift and selection pressure can create greater diversity than geographical separation (<span class="citation" data-cites="pandey2015morphological">Pandey et al. (2015)</span>; <span class="citation" data-cites="singh2020genetic">S. Singh et al. (2020)</span>). This finding has important implications for breeding programs, suggesting that local germplasm may harbor unexploited genetic diversity.</p>
<p>Cluster V (SVPR-1) shows highest yield potential, Cluster IV (Soma) exhibits superior plant architecture, and Cluster VI (KYM-1) offers early maturity with high oil content. Strategic crosses between distant clusters (III × IV) could maximize genetic variation in breeding populations.</p>
<p>Recent molecular diversity studies using SNP markers have corroborated these findings. <span class="citation" data-cites="wang2016genome">Wang et al. (2016)</span> analyzed 705 sesame accessions using genome-wide SNPs and found similar clustering patterns, with genetic diversity being more strongly associated with breeding history than geographical origin. The maximum divergence between Clusters III and IV (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D%5E2%20=%2075.04">) in our study corresponds to regions of low genetic similarity identified in genomic studies <span class="citation" data-cites="dossa2017transcriptomic">(Dossa et al. 2017)</span>.</p>
<p>Based on comprehensive evaluation, several genotypes emerged as superior performers across multiple traits as depicted Figure&nbsp;2. SVPR-1 demonstrated the highest seed yield (7.02 g/plant), while KYM-1 showed the earliest flowering and highest oil content. Soma exhibited exceptional plant architecture with maximum height and branching.</p>

<p>The combination of high heritability with high genetic advance for days to flowering, plant height, number of branches per plant, number of capsules per plant, and seed yield per plant suggests predominant additive gene action, making these traits responsive to simple selection methods <span class="citation" data-cites="burton1952quantitative singh2006biometrical">(Burton 1952; A. Singh and Chaudhary 2006)</span>. These findings align with recent reports by <span class="citation" data-cites="gangwar2021genetic">Gangwar et al. (2021)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="ahmad2020genetic">Ahmad et al. (2020)</span>, and <span class="citation" data-cites="yahaya2021genetic">Yahaya et al. (2021)</span>, who observed similar patterns in diverse sesame germplasm collections.</p>
<p>The strong positive correlation between number of capsules per plant and seed yield (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%20=%200.9558%5E%7B**%7D">) confirms this trait as the most reliable selection criterion for yield improvement. Path analysis further substantiated this relationship by revealing the highest direct effect (1.1063) of capsule number on seed yield. Similar findings have been reported in recent studies by <span class="citation" data-cites="kumar2019genetic">R. Kumar et al. (2019)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="gangwar2021genetic">Gangwar et al. (2021)</span>, and <span class="citation" data-cites="ahmad2020genetic">Ahmad et al. (2020)</span>. The characters plant height, branches per plant, capsules per plant, and oil content showed significant and positive association with seed yield per plant. Therefore, simultaneous improvement of seed yield may be possible through selection of these characters. These matched the reports and conclusions of <span class="citation" data-cites="kumar2022genetic">V. Kumar et al. (2022)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="patel2023genetic">Patel et al. (2023)</span>.</p>
<p>Modern breeding programs increasingly utilize these correlation patterns in genomic prediction models. <span class="citation" data-cites="zhang2013genetic">Zhang et al. (2013)</span> demonstrated that incorporating trait correlations into genomic selection algorithms improved prediction accuracy for seed yield by 25% compared to single-trait models. The strong genetic correlations observed in our study suggest that multi-trait selection indices could be particularly effective in sesame breeding <span class="citation" data-cites="yu2019pmdbase">(Yu et al. 2019)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="murthy1996">Murthy and Kulkarni (1996)</span> explained that wide adaptability of divergent types could be possible due to factors such as heterogeneity, genetic architecture of the populations, past history of selection, developmental factors, and degree of general combining ability. In the present study, varieties developed at the same location were found to be grouped in different clusters, indicating more divergence. For example, sesame varieties from Kerala Agricultural University were found to be grouped in Clusters II, IV, and VI. This confirms the earlier findings of <span class="citation" data-cites="raut1991">Raut et al. (1991)</span> that genetic drift and human selection could cause greater diversity than geographical spacing.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="angadi1976">Angadi (1976)</span> reported that varieties in a cluster with a high order of divergence among themselves would be the best breeding materials for achieving maximum genetic advance with regard to yield. Selection within a cluster might also be exercised based on the highest mean performance of the varieties for desirable traits such as seed yield.</p>

<section id="conclusion" class="level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This comprehensive genetic analysis of 40 sesame genotypes revealed substantial genetic variability suitable for breeding programs. High heritability estimates coupled with significant genetic advance indicate favorable prospects for genetic improvement through selection. Number of capsules per plant emerged as the most critical trait for yield improvement, while genetic divergence analysis identified optimal parent combinations for hybridization programs.</p>
<p>The identification of genetically divergent clusters provides a scientific basis for systematic breeding approaches. Integration of conventional breeding with molecular markers and genomic selection offers promising avenues for accelerating genetic gains. Future breeding efforts should prioritize crosses between genotypes from distant clusters while maintaining focus on high-performing individuals within clusters.</p>
<p>The superior genotypes identified in this study (SVPR-1, Soma, KYM-1, and Tilatara) represent valuable genetic resources for developing climate-resilient varieties with enhanced yield potential and oil quality. This research establishes a foundation for modern sesame breeding programs, contributing to the revival of this ancient yet underutilized crop in the context of sustainable agriculture and food security.</p>

<p>In India, the agricultural waste generated by crops is significantly higher than in many other countries. Due to the lack of suitable technologies for effective disposal, farmers often resort to burning the crop residues as a quick and convenient method to clear fields. According to <span class="citation" data-cites="singh2014">Singh and Kaskaoutis (2014)</span>, about 43% of the total crop stubbles produced in India is burnt in-situ, contributing substantially to air pollution. One promising solution to mitigate the environmental impact of crop residue burning is the conversion of crop residues into biochar, a carbon rich material produced through pyrolysis. <span class="citation" data-cites="punnoose2015article">Punnoose and Anitha (2015)</span> has reported that biomass possesses several beneficial physical properties including low bulk density, high porosity, and higher water holding capacity. When applied to soil, these properties make biochar, an effective soil conditioner, enhancing both water and nutrient retention in soil and improves the crop yield. In Kerala, tender coconut husk is a prominent form of agricultural waste which requires efficient and ecofriendly disposal methods. Although, a portion of this agricultural waste is currently utilized through composting or as mulch in coconut gardens, these practices are insufficient relative to the large volume of waste produced. The dried tender coconut husk holds significant potential for conversion into biochar, which can then be recycled back into agricultural use to boost soil productivity. The Onattukara tract spread over three districts of Kerala (Alappuzha, Kollam and Pathanamthitta) presents a unique challenge due to its coarse textured, sandy loam soils with inherently low nutrient status. This type of soil is prone to nutrient leaching, especially during rainfall, rendering the applied fertilizers as less effective. Given biochar’s ability to improve soil moisture retention and reduce nutrient leaching, it represents a promising amendment for such type of soils. Therefore, a study was conducted to evaluate the potential of tender coconut husk biochar as a soil conditioner for okra cultivation in the sandy loam soils of Onattukara region.</p>

<p>A field experiment was conducted during the summer of 2023 in the wetlands of the Instructional Farm attached to Onattukara Regional Agricultural Research Station, Kayamkulam, Kerala. The research station is situated at 9.177° North latitude and 76.517° East longitude and at an altitude of 3.05 m above mean sea level. The treatments were laid out in randomized block design comprising of eight treatment combinations of biochar along with two levels of recommended dose of nutrients for okra along with a control and were replicated thrice. The treatments were t1 (biochar @ <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?5%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bt%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D"> + 100% RDF)<sup>1</sup>, t2 (biochar @ <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?10%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bt%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D"> + 100% RDF), t3 (biochar @ <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?5%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bt%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D"> + <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?5%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bt%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D"> FYM + 100% RDF)<sup>2</sup>, t4 (biochar @ <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?10%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bt%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D"> + <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?5%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bt%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D"> FYM + 100% RDF), t5 (biochar @ <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?5%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bt%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D"> + 75% RDF), t6 (biochar @ <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?10%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bt%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D"> + 75% RDF), t7 (biochar @ <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?5%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bt%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D"> + <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?5%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bt%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D"> FYM + 75% RDF), t8 (biochar @ <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?10%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bt%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D"> + <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?5%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bt%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D"> FYM + 75% RDF), and t9 (<span class="citation" data-cites="kau2016">KAU POP (2016)</span>-<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?20%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bt%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D"> FYM + 100% RDF).</p>
<p>Prior to sowing, the experimental area was cleared of stubbles and clods were broken thoroughly. Dolomite was applied uniformly at the rate of 1 t ha<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5E%7B-1%7D"> and was incorporated in soil during primary tillage. The field was laid out as per the treatment design. After the layout, biochar and farmyard manure, along with half N, full P and full K of chemical fertilizers were applied in soil as per the treatments just before sowing. The remaining N was given in soil at one month after sowing along with intercultural operations and earthing up. The seeds of okra var. Arka Anamika were sown in lines in the main field at a spacing of 60 cm × 30 cm. The crop was sown during the last week of January 2023. After sowing, uniform population was maintained by thinning and gap filling. Five random plants from each net plot were selected and tagged as observational plants for recording observations.</p>
<p>The number of days taken for the first flower to open was noted and the mean was worked out. To find the number of fruits per plant, the fruits obtained from different harvests from each of the five observational plants were recorded separately and the average was worked out. The length of the fruits, from the tip of the fruit to the stalk end, was measured from the observational plants and the average was calculated and expressed in cm. The weight of the fruits harvested from each of the observational plants was recorded after each harvest. After the final harvest, the total weight of fruits obtained from the observational plants at different harvests were worked out, averaged and expressed in kilograms for fruit yield per plant. The weight of fruits from each plot excluding the border plants was recorded after each harvest and summed at the end of the cropping season to compute the yield in terms of kg per plot and was converted into t ha<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5E%7B-1%7D">.</p>
<p>The harvest index was calculated using the following formula suggested by Donald and Hamblin (1976). It was calculated by dividing the economic yield with biological yield of the plant. Sample plants collected from each plot were chopped into small pieces and were sun dried. After the initial drying, the samples were dried in oven to attain constant weight. The samples were then ground to pass through a 0.5 mm mesh and the required quantity of samples were digested and used for nutrient analysis following standard procedures. The nutrient uptake was calculated and expressed in kg ha<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5E%7B-1%7D"> according to Equation&nbsp;1.</p>
<p><span id="eq-eq1"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctext%7BNutrient%20uptake%20(kg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D%5Ctext%7B)%7D%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Ctext%7BNutrient%20content%20(%5C%25)%7D%20%5Ctimes%20%5Ctext%7BDry%20matter%20production%20(kg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D%5Ctext%7B)%7D%7D%7B100%7D%20%5Ctag%7B1%7D"></span></p>
<p>The composite soil samples from the field before the experiment and from each plot after the experiment were collected, air dried, powdered and passed through a 2 mm sieve and analysed for physico-chemical properties of the soil (Table&nbsp;1). The soil samples passed through 0.2 mm sieve were used for organic carbon estimation. Values represented in Table&nbsp;1 are initial soil values.</p>

<p>The application of biochar significantly influenced certain yield traits of okra. Days to flowering ranged between 35 and 37 days after sowing (DAS) across all treatments, but the differences were not statistically significant. Similarly, the number of fruits per plant and fruit length did not differ significantly among treatments. However, fruit yield per plant was significantly affected by biochar application (Table&nbsp;2). Treatment t4 resulted in the highest fruit yield per plant (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?544.93%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bg%7D">) and was statistically at par with t3 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?537.74%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bg%7D">), while the lowest was recorded in t9 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?380.24%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bg%7D">). Yield per hectare followed a similar trend, with t4 yielding <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?15.71%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bt%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D"> and was found to be on par with t3 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?14.07%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bt%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">), and the lowest yield observed in t9 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?7.65%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bt%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">). The harvest index was also positively influenced, with t3 registering the highest value (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0.81">), which was statistically similar to t4 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0.81">), t2 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0.79">), t1 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0.79">), and t8 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0.77">).</p>

Potassium uptake was not significantly affected by any treatment. For calcium, t6 showed the highest uptake (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?64.94%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">), comparable to t3, t7, and t4.

Zinc and boron uptakes were not significantly influenced by treatments. Iron uptake was significantly higher in t6 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0.96%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">), which was at par with t1 and t3. Manganese uptake was highest in t8 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1.69%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">), statistically similar to t7, t4, and t2.</p>

<p>Post-harvest soil analysis revealed that biochar application significantly influenced several soil physico-chemical parameters. Water holding capacity was significantly higher in t4 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?33.87%5C%25">), followed by t8, t3, t2, and t7. Bulk density was lowest in t8 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1.21%5C%20%5Ctext%7BMg%20m%7D%5E%7B-3%7D">), while t9 recorded the highest (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1.30%5C%20%5Ctext%7BMg%20m%7D%5E%7B-3%7D">). No significant differences were found in soil pH, electrical conductivity (EC), or cation exchange capacity (CEC). Organic carbon content increased significantly with biochar application, highest in t4 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1.29%5C%25">), and statistically comparable to t8, t3, t2, t7, t1, and t6. Available nitrogen content also improved, with t4 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?209.07%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">) showing significantly higher values, followed by t3, t8, and t7. However, the availability of phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sulphur, copper, zinc, iron, boron, and manganese in the soil was not significantly affected by the treatments.</p>

<p>The treatments did not influence the days taken to flower in okra. In general, regardless of the treatments, the okra plants started to flower between 35 DAS and 37 DAS. The number of fruits per plant and length of fruits were not influenced by biochar. However, the fruit yield per plant was significantly improved by the incorporation of biochar. The highest yield per plant was obtained from t4 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?544.93%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bg%7D">) and was found to be on a par with the treatment t3 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?537.74%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bg%7D"> per plant). There was 35.60 per cent increase over t9. Higher fruit yield per plant was observed for the plants that received biochar and FYM along with 100 per cent recommended dose of fertilizers (RDF). The adsorbing property of biochar in sandy loam soil might have slowed down the release of nutrients from FYM and chemical fertilizers. As the amount of biochar was doubled, there was an increase in fresh weight of fruits. This is in accordance with the findings of <span class="citation" data-cites="dainy2015">Dainy (2015)</span> who also reported a progressive increment in the yield characters in yard long bean as the levels of biochar was enhanced from 10 to 30 t ha<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5E%7B-1%7D"> when applied along with the recommended dose of fertilizers. Similar reports of increased yield with the incorporation of biochar and RDF were also reported by <span class="citation" data-cites="punnoose2015thesis">Punnoose (2015)</span> in amaranthus and <span class="citation" data-cites="hashmi2019">Hashmi et al. (2019)</span> in <em>Pisum sativum</em> L. In the case of fruit yield ha<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5E%7B-1%7D">, the application of tender coconut husk biochar had significantly improved the yield per hectare in okra. Higher fruit yield per hectare was observed for the treatment t4 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?15.71%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bt%7D">) and was on par with t3 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?14.07%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bt%7D">). The control plants (t9) could only produce <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?7.65%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bt%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">. Overall, there was a yield increase of 69 per cent in t4 compared to t9. The lower yield in t9 might be due to the leaching loss of nutrients. There was 44 mm rainfall during the growth period of okra at Onattukara which might have aggravated the leaching loss in the sandy loam soils of Onattukara. <span class="citation" data-cites="nagula2017">Nagula (2017)</span> had also recommended the application of biochar (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?@"> 10 kg ha<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5E%7B-1%7D">) along with RDN for higher yield in banana. The harvest index was also significantly influenced by the treatments. The treatment t3 recorded a higher harvest index of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0.81"> and was found to be on a par with the treatments t4 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0.81">), t2 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0.79">), t1 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0.79">) and t8 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0.77">). Thus, biochar as a soil conditioner along with FYM and full recommended dose of fertilizers was effective for okra in the sandy loam soils of Onattukara.</p>

<h3 data-number="4.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="nutrient-uptake-1"><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Nutrient uptake</h3>
<p>The N uptake in okra was significantly improved due to the treatments. Among the treatments, the highest N uptake was recorded by the treatment t4 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?101.35%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">) and was found to be on a par with t3 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?95.93%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">), t2 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?92.90%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">), t6 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?92.70%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">) and t5 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?91.93%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">). Lower N uptake was recorded in t9. There was an increase of 30.14 percent in the N uptake (t4) compared to control (t9). This might be due to the adsorbing capacity of biochar applied as soil conditioner. The higher CEC for biochar might have helped in retaining N in the sandy loam soils of Onattukara. The full RDN along with FYM (5 t ha<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5E%7B-1%7D">), combined with the adsorbing property of biochar might have contributed to a higher status of available N in soil and led to an increased uptake of N by okra. <span class="citation" data-cites="dainy2015">Dainy (2015)</span> had earlier reported that the total N uptake in yard long bean was found to increase from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?51.19%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D"> to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?105.50%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D"> due to the application of biochar, PGPR and full recommended dose of nutrients. <span class="citation" data-cites="jabin2022">Jabin (2022)</span> had also reported that total N uptake was higher in ginger when treated with paddy husk biochar (30 t ha<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5E%7B-1%7D">) along with full dose of fertilizers in sandy soils. Similarly, <span class="citation" data-cites="nigussie2012">Nigussie et al. (2012)</span> had also reported a higher N uptake in lettuces grown in soils conditioned with 10 t ha<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5E%7B-1%7D"> biochar suggesting the prospects of biochar to raise fertilizer use efficiency in soils where N loss is high.</p>
<p>A significant difference was observed in P uptake among the treatments. Higher P uptake was observed for t7 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?24.76%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">) and was on a par with t8 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?23.73%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">), t6 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?22.57%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">), t5 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?19.98%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">) and t3 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?19.60%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">). This increase in P uptake might be due to the higher quantity of available P in soil which is evident from the soil samples collected after the harvest of okra (Table&nbsp;6). In acidic soils, the solubility of P and its uptake by plants depends mainly on the formation of Al and Fe-phosphates in soil. When biochar is applied to acidic soil condition, it raises the soil pH. There is a reduction in the P binding to Fe and Al oxides, thus making P available in soil. Similar reports of improved P availability in acid soils due to supplementation of biochar was observed by <span class="citation" data-cites="chintala2014">Chintala et al. (2014)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="zhang2016">H. Zhang et al. (2016)</span>. On the contrary, <span class="citation" data-cites="dainy2015">Dainy (2015)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="jabin2022">Jabin (2022)</span> had reported a higher P uptake in yard long bean and ginger, treated with biochar along with NPK as per <span class="citation" data-cites="kau2016">KAU POP (2016)</span>. The uptake of K was not significantly influenced by the treatments.</p>
<p>Significant effect for Ca uptake was observed in okra (Table&nbsp;4). The highest Ca uptake was recorded by the treatment t6 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?64.94%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">) and was noticed to be on a par with treatment t3 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?59.72%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">), t7 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?59.38%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">) and t4 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?58.61%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">). Lower Ca uptake was recorded by the treatment t9 (KAU POP). There was an overall increase of calcium uptake by 44.96% in t6 compared to the control t9. The application of biochar along with liming prior to planting okra was found to improve the availability of calcium in soil which might have led to an increased plant uptake. Earlier, <span class="citation" data-cites="sombroek1993">Sombroek, Nachtergaele, and Hebel (1993)</span> had also reported increased calcium availability for plant growth after the application of biochar due to the higher surface area, negative surface charge and charge density. Moreover, calcium in biochar may exchange Al ions present on the soil organic matter and enhance the availability of calcium for plants thus, guiding it to an increased calcium uptake by the plants <span class="citation" data-cites="novak2009">(Novak et al. 2009)</span>. <span class="citation" data-cites="dainy2015">Dainy (2015)</span> had also reported higher Ca uptake in yard long bean due to the application of biochar. In sandy soils, <span class="citation" data-cites="jabin2022">Jabin (2022)</span> also observed a higher calcium uptake in ginger.</p>
<p>The uptake of Mg was observed to be significant (Table&nbsp;4). The treatment t4 resulted in higher Mg uptake (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?20.47%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">) by okra and was noticed to be on a par with the treatment t3 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?19.84%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">), t6 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?19.61%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">) and t8 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?19.60%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">). The Mg in soil increases with increase in soil pH. There was an increment in soil pH from the initial value of 5.38 (Table&nbsp;1) to 5.87 (Table&nbsp;5) due to application of biochar in combination with the effect of liming. This might have improved the exchangeable magnesium in soil which has resulted in an increased magnesium uptake in okra. <span class="citation" data-cites="jabin2022">Jabin (2022)</span> has also reported an increased magnesium uptake in ginger due to application of biochar. Tender coconut husk biochar had 0.13 percent magnesium <span class="citation" data-cites="vikram2024">(Vikram et al. 2024)</span>. This might have contributed to the higher magnesium content in t4. <span class="citation" data-cites="dainy2015">Dainy (2015)</span> had also reported an increase in total Mg uptake in yard long bean when biochar (@ 20 t ha<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5E%7B-1%7D">) was applied with RDN. The uptake of sulphur was not significantly influenced by the treatments.</p>
<p>Copper uptake was found to be significant (Table&nbsp;4) for the treatments. Higher copper uptake in okra was observed for the treatment t1 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1.82%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">) and was found to be on a par with the treatment t3 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1.73%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">). There was an increase in copper content in soil from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1.31%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bmg%20kg%7D%5E%7B-1%7D"> (Table&nbsp;1) to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1.45%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bmg%20kg%7D%5E%7B-1%7D"> (Table&nbsp;7) due to the application of biochar. This might have contributed to the increased uptake of copper in okra. Similar reports of increased copper uptake were noticed in yard long beans by <span class="citation" data-cites="dainy2015">Dainy (2015)</span> and in rice by <span class="citation" data-cites="salvacion2020">Salvacion and Pangga (2020)</span> due to the application of biochar.</p>
<p>The uptake of zinc was not significantly influenced by the treatments. The uptake of iron in okra was found to be significant (Table&nbsp;4). Higher iron uptake was observed for t6 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0.96%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">) and was perceived to be on a par with treatment t1 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0.88%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">) and t3 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0.82%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">). The biochar produced from tender coconut husk contains <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?107.58%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bmg%20kg%7D%5E%7B-1%7D"> of iron <span class="citation" data-cites="vikram2024">(Vikram et al. 2024)</span>, and hence its application as a soil conditioner had increased the soil iron content. The initial soil available iron was <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?14.74%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bmg%20kg%7D%5E%7B-1%7D"> (Table&nbsp;1) and was increased to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?15.53%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bmg%20kg%7D%5E%7B-1%7D"> (t6 – Table&nbsp;7) due to the application of biochar. This might be the reason for the increased availability of iron in soil which might have contributed to the increased iron uptake in t6 treatment. Similar report of increased iron uptake in yard long bean was observed by <span class="citation" data-cites="dainy2015">Dainy (2015)</span>.</p>
<p>The uptake of boron was not significantly influenced by the treatments. The uptake of manganese was found to be significantly influenced by the treatments (Table&nbsp;4). Among the treatments, the highest uptake of manganese was recorded by the treatment t8 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1.69%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">) and was observed to be on a par with treatment t7 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1.68%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">), t4 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1.67%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">), t6 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1.61%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">) and t2 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1.46%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">). The application of biochar had slightly improved the soil available manganese. This might have improved the plant uptake of manganese in okra. Earlier, <span class="citation" data-cites="dainy2015">Dainy (2015)</span> had also reported the increase in total uptake of manganese from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?559.93"> to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1140.50%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D"> due to application of biochar in yard long bean.</p>

<p>The soil water holding capacity after cultivation of okra was significantly modified due to the treatments. The initial water holding capacity of the soil from the experimental area (Table&nbsp;1) was <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?10.47%5C%25">. The treatment t4 recorded a significantly higher WHC (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?33.87%5C%25">) and was found on a par with t8 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?33.02%5C%25">), t3 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?32.73%5C%25">), t2 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?32.65%5C%25">) and t7 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?32.61%5C%25">). An increase of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?20.68%5C%25"> in water holding capacity was observed in t4 (compared to control). An overall increase of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?105.55%5C%25"> of WHC could be obtained due to application of biochar in the sandy loam soils of Onattukara. The initial analysis of tender coconut husk biochar had revealed that it had a water holding capacity of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?232.34%5C%25">. This biochar when applied to soil reduces the bulk density of soil and is the reason for the higher water holding capacity of the soil. There was <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?57.92%5C%25"> increase in WHC with the application of biochar along with NPK as per POP recommendation <span class="citation" data-cites="dainy2015">(Dainy 2015)</span>. <span class="citation" data-cites="wang2019">Wang et al. (2019)</span> has also reported that biochar can temporarily increase the field capacity due to their higher pore volume in a coarse textured soil.</p>
<p>The bulk density of soil was found to be significantly reduced by the treatments. The initial bulk density of the soil from the experimental area was <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1.61%5C%20%5Ctext%7BMg%20m%7D%5E%7B-3%7D">. In general, biochar had significantly reduced the soil’s bulk density. KAU 2016 (t9) recorded the highest bulk density (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1.30%5C%20%5Ctext%7BMg%20m%7D%5E%7B-3%7D">) in soil and the lowest was recorded for the treatment t8 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1.21%5C%20%5Ctext%7BMg%20m%7D%5E%7B-3%7D">). Overall, there was a reduction in bulk density by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?28.37%5C%25"> compared to the initial value indicating the potential for increased water holding capacity.

The pH, electrical conductivity and CEC in soil after the experiment was not significantly influenced by the treatments.</p>
<p>The organic carbon content of the soil after the experiment was significantly governed by the treatments. Higher organic carbon was noticed for t4 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1.29%5C%25">) and was on par with t8 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1.26%5C%25">), t3 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1.25%5C%25">), t2 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1.23%5C%25">), t7 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1.23%5C%25">), t1 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1.19%5C%25">) and t6 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1.17%5C%25">). The control treatment (t9) recorded the lowest organic carbon content (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0.96%5C%25">). There was an overall increase of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?29.33%5C%25"> in t4 compared to KAU (2016) due to the application of biochar. The initial organic carbon content in soil before the experiment was <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0.53%5C%25"> (Table&nbsp;1).

In amaranthus, <span class="citation" data-cites="punnoose2015article">Punnoose and Anitha (2015)</span> had also reported higher organic carbon content in biochar applied plants.</p>
<p>There were significant effects on available N in soil. Higher available N was observed for t4 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?209.07%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">) and was on a par with the treatments t3, t7 and t8 with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?196.52%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">. This might be due to the increased retention of nitrogen in soil due to the application of biochar. <span class="citation" data-cites="punnoose2015thesis">Punnoose (2015)</span> had also reported an increased nutrient content in biochar applied soils. The control (t9) recorded an available N content of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?183.98%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">. There was <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?44%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bmm%7D"> of rain during the crop period which might have leached out the available N in soil leading to a comparatively lesser available N in soil.

The lower dose of fertilizer without the application of FYM might have led to the lowest available N in soil.</p>

<h2 data-number="1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>Price volatility is one of the significant sources of risk in agriculture especially in fruits and vegetable production. It is defined as the directionless fluctuations in prices that cannot be predicted with market fundamentals <span class="citation" data-cites="prakash2011">(Prakash 2011)</span>. Reasons for price volatility include supply-side shocks due to severe weather events or diseases, variations in demand, distortions in trade policies and supply chain disruptions <span class="citation" data-cites="gilbert2010 ait_sidhoum2016">(Gilbert and Morgan 2010; Ait Sidhoum and Serra 2016)</span>. The increasing unpredictability of changing economic and natural environment <span class="citation" data-cites="tothova2011">(Tothova 2011)</span> and seasonal nature of the fruits and vegetables also amplifies price volatility. Moreover, poor shelf life of horticulture crops increases risk and leads to unstable markets <span class="citation" data-cites="cook2011">(Cook 2011)</span>.</p>
<p>Vazhakulam in Ernakulam district has become the major hub for pineapple cultivation in Kerala <span class="citation" data-cites="joy2013">(Joy 2013)</span>. Owing to its unique feature Vazhakulam pineapple has got Geographical indication tag also. Pineapple produced from the region has a long value chain and is marketed to various states like Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Delhi mainly through road ways. Limited quantity of fresh pineapple is being exported to Gulf countries in special packings <span class="citation" data-cites="pga2018">(Pineapple Growers Association 2018)</span>.</p>
<p>Pineapple is a globally traded fruit crop from Kerala that had always been subject to price volatility. It is mainly because of the seasonal variations in demand for pineapple in markets. Climate change induced low production, seasonal disruptions in demand and supply are the main factors that affect price volatility. It was noted that the COVID induced lock down had severely affected the pineapple prices and farmer suicides were reported during the period. This pandemic had a significant negative impact on all sectors of human life, including the economy, food security and health <span class="citation" data-cites="saadat2020">(Saadat, Rawtani, and Hussain 2020)</span>. According to <span class="citation" data-cites="jribi2020">(Jribi et al. 2020)</span>, the pandemic had the potential to hinder the progress towards meeting several Sustainable Development Goals (United Nations SDG 2015-2030), in particular, SDG 2 (End Hunger) and SDG 12 (Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns). There were widespread disruptions in agriculture supply chain at the beginning of the lockdown <span class="citation" data-cites="fao2021">(FAO 2021)</span>. It further lead to the scarcity of labour, disrupted supply chains and lack of demand and logistics restrictions in the agricultural sector <span class="citation" data-cites="cariappa2021">(Cariappa et al. 2021)</span>.</p>
<p>Although the price volatility of different agricultural commodities has been researched extensively in recent periods <span class="citation" data-cites="gilbert2010 sabu2019 yu2020">(Gilbert and Morgan 2010; Sabu, Kuruvila, and Manojkumar 2019; Yu et al. 2020)</span>, a lack of knowledge exists in the pineapple sector of Kerala. The knowledge about the price risk and volatility associated with the pineapple sector is important for pineapple farmers during the pandemic. This information is critical for developing suitable price risk management strategies, for coping up with similar situations. Hence the present study aims to analyse the price behaviour of Pineapple in Kerala.</p>

<h3 data-number="2.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="study-area"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Study area</h3>
<p>The study was conducted in Ernakulam district of Kerala. The study area was selected purposively as it has the largest area under pineapple cultivation in Kerala. Out of the total area under pineapple in Kerala, 58.73 per cent lies in Ernakulam district which produces about 63 per cent of the production of the state in the year <span class="citation" data-cites="gok2020a">(Government of Kerala 2020a)</span>. From the district, Muvattupuzha Block Panchayath was purposively selected based on the maximum area under pineapple cultivation. Three pineapple-growing grama panchayats viz., Avoly, Manjalloor, and Kalloorkkad were selected from the block panchayat randomly. Forty farmers each were randomly selected from these grama panchayaths making a total sample size of 120 farmers.</p>

<h3 data-number="2.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sampling-and-data-collection"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Sampling and data collection</h3>
<p>The study used time series data of daily prices of pineapple from January 2017 to September 2022 collected from Vazhakulam Pineapple Growers Association(PGA). Price collected can be aptly considered as representative price as most of the pineapple farmers are organized under PGA and trade pineapple through them. The prices represent the farm gate price received by the farmers and it is easily available in the website of Pineapple Growers Association<span class="citation" data-cites="pga2018">(Pineapple Growers Association 2018)</span>. Data on daily prices of pineapple from January 2017 to March 2020 was taken as pre-COVID period and from April 2020 to September 2022 is taken as COVID-post-COVID period. January 2017 to September 2022 was taken as the overall period.</p>

<h3 data-number="2.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="garch-models"><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> GARCH models</h3>
<p>The uncertainty surrounding prospective price fluctuation is referred to as volatility. There are different methods to estimate volatility such as historical moving average, Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA), Auto Regressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (ARCH) introduced by <span class="citation" data-cites="engle1982">Engle (1982)</span> and Generalized Auto-Regressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) introduced by <span class="citation" data-cites="bollerslev1986">Bollerslev (1986)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="sekhar2004">Sekhar (2004)</span> compared the price volatility of different agricultural commodities in major Indian and international markets by using GARCH model. This model provided evidence on whether the estimated volatility is statistically significant or not. It also measures the persistence of volatility <span class="citation" data-cites="sabu2015">(Sabu 2015)</span>.</p>
<p>The ARCH process introduced by Engle (1982) explicitly recognizes the difference between the unconditional and the conditional variance allowing the latter to change over time as a function of past errors. The GARCH model of <span class="citation" data-cites="bollerslev1986">Bollerslev (1986)</span> is an important type of time series model for heteroscedastic data. It explicitly models a time-varying conditional variance as a linear function of past squared residuals and of its past values. GARCH models are an extension of the ARCH models first introduced by Engle (1982) as it basically introduces a lagged conditional variance to the information set of an ARCH model. An ARCH model applied to price volatility basically assumes that a dependent variable of commodity prices, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P_i">, is generated by the autoregressive process:</p>
<p><span id="eq-archmean"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p_i%20=%20%5Cphi_0%20+%20%5Csum_%7Bi=1%7D%5E%7Bk%7D%20%5Cphi_%7B1%7D%20P_%7Bt-1%7D%20+%20%5Cvarepsilon_t%20%5Ctag%7B1%7D"></span></p>
<p>To generate the ARCH<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(p)"> process, we express the conditional variance of the above expression as a function of its past values squared:</p>
<p><span id="eq-archdist"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cvarepsilon_t%20%5Cmid%20%5COmega_%7Bt-1%7D%20%5Csim%20N(0,%20h)%20%5Ctag%7B2%7D"></span></p>

<p>Where, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?h_t%5E2"> denotes the conditional variance of the information set <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5COmega_%7Bt-1%7D"> that is available at time <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t-1">, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdelta%20%3E%200">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Calpha_i%20%5Cgeq%200"> for all <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i%20=%202%20%5Cldots%20p"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Calpha_1%20+%20%5Calpha_2%20+%20%5Ccdots%20+%20%5Calpha_m%20%3C%201">, which are necessary to make <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cvarepsilon_t%5E2"> positive and covariance stationary.</p>
<p>The generalization of the ARCH process given in Equation&nbsp;3 is as follows <span class="citation" data-cites="bollerslev1986">(Bollerslev 1986)</span>:</p>
<p><span id="eq-archboller"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ah_t%5E2%20=%20%5Cdelta%20+%20%5Csum_%7Bi=1%7D%5E%7Bp%7D%20%5Calpha_i%20%5Cvarepsilon_%7Bt-i%7D%5E2%20+%20%5Csum_%7Bi=1%7D%5E%7Bq%7D%20%5Cbeta_i%20h_%7Bt-i%7D%5E2%0A%5Ctag%7B4%7D"></span></p>
<p>The GARCH model in Equation&nbsp;4 depicts the conditional variance of a price series to depend on a constant, past news about volatility (i.e.&nbsp;the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cvarepsilon_%7Bt-1%7D%5E2"> terms). Including the lagged conditional variances might capture the “adaptive learning” phenomenon. The benefit of the GARCH specification is that it contains fewer coefficient restrictions. For a well-defined variance and covariance function: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdelta,%20%5Calpha%20%3E%200;%20%5Cbeta%20%5Cgeq%200">, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Calpha%20+%20%5Cbeta%20%3C%201">.</p>
<p>Persistence of volatility in the commodity series is measured by the sum of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Calpha%20+%20%5Cbeta">. Downward price changes are often followed by higher volatility than upward movements of the same magnitude <span class="citation" data-cites="herrera2008">(Herrera and Espinel 2008)</span>.</p>
<p>Models aim to define volatility clustering and effects such as kurtosis, forming the basis of dynamic volatility models.</p>
<p>The key is that volatility, rather than remaining constant or moving in a monotonic manner over time, is dependent on past realisations of the associated volatility i.e.&nbsp;the error variance is related to the squared error terms over several periods in the past <span class="citation" data-cites="singh2020">(Singh 2020)</span>.</p>
<p>The ARCH-GARCH model was used to analyse the volatility and it was estimated using <code>R</code> software <span class="citation" data-cites="rcoreteam2023">(R Core Team 2023)</span>. From the different models, Standard GARCH (1,1) (SGARCH) model was identified as the best model for this study based on the smallest Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) values <span class="citation" data-cites="lestari2022">(Lestari et al. 2022)</span>. This model distinguishes the predictable and unpredictable components of prices and also allows the variance of the unpredictable element to be time-varying. Such time varying conditional variances were estimated by using the SGARCH (1,1) model <span class="citation" data-cites="gujarati2009">(Gujarati, Porter, and Gunasekhar 2009)</span> and it was used to identify periods of high volatility.</p>
<p>The GARCH(1,1) model is specified as:</p>
<p><span id="eq-garchmodel"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y_%7Bit%7D%20=%20%5Calpha_0%20+%20%5Cbeta_1%20P_%7Bt-1%7D%20+%20%5Cbeta_2%20P_%7Bt-2%7D%20+%20%5Cvarepsilon_t%20%5Cquad%20;%20%5Cquad%20t%20=%201,%202,%20%5Cldots,%20t%20%5Ctag%7B5%7D"></span></p>

The term <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(%5Calpha_i%20+%20%5Cbeta_i)"> indicates the degree of persistence in price volatility.

<p>The general form of a GARCH(<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?q">) model is:</p>

<p>In Vazhakulam, fresh pineapple is harvested at two stages: as green pineapple (harvested at 115 days after the ethephon application) and as ripe pineapple (harvested at 120–125 days after the ethephon application).</p>
<p>The present study analyzed the price volatility of both ripe and green pineapple using time series data of daily prices from January 2017 to September 2022. For analytical purposes, the data set was divided into the following three periods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pre-COVID period: January 2017 to March 2020<br>
</li>
<li>COVID–Post-COVID period: April 2020 to September 2022</li>
</ul>
<p>The average monthly prices of both green and ripe pineapple during the pre-COVID and COVID–post-COVID periods are presented in Figure&nbsp;1 (a) and Figure&nbsp;1 (b), respectively.</p>

<p>Price of pineapple usually stood high during the summer months of April and May coinciding with summer and one-month long Ramdan fasting. So, many farmers targeted the harvest of the crop during these months. But in April 2020, during the first lockdown period due to strict restrictions, many pineapple plantations were abandoned without harvesting. This was mainly due to the unavailability of migrant labours (as they went back to their hometown fearing the disease). So, a steep decline in price was observed during that period. Prices started increasing as the restrictions were lifted gradually. Again in 2021, there was price drop in the months of May and June due to another lockdown and restrictions.</p>
<p>The price drop was to the level of Rs. 10/kg, which put farmers in distress. During the survey, many farmers reported that the price of pineapple had even dipped to Rs. 5/kg during the COVID period as they were not able to transport the produce to the Vazhakulam pineapple market. So, they sold produce in nearby markets. Many of the plantations were kept unharvested and harvested fruits fetched only very low price. Restrictions in interstate and intra state transport, fear of spread of virus through the fruits etc. worsened the situation. Many farmers terminated their lease contracts with landowners before expiry due to financial crisis and were unable to pay the lease amount and continue farming operations. Farmers reported that the reduction in the cultivated area had impacted total pineapple production from Vazhakulam. As the restrictions were gradually lifted towards the end of 2021, situation became normal and price hike was observed due to a reduced supply of pineapple to the market, with the demand for pineapple was same as earlier.</p>

<p>The results showed that the GARCH(1,1) model estimates for ripe and green pineapple prices were significant for the pre-COVID, COVID and post-COVID, and overall periods. It indicated that the volatility in the prices of pineapple was persistent despite the COVID-induced lockdown.</p>
<p>It is evident from Table&nbsp;1 that the sum of coefficients <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Calpha"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbeta"> for the prices of ripe pineapple was higher in the COVID-post-COVID period, followed by the overall period. This indicated higher volatility in the prices of ripe pineapple during the COVID-post-COVID period. A similar trend was observed in the price of green pineapple (Table&nbsp;2). This might be related to the reduced demand for pineapple in the market as a result of changes in the consumption behaviour of people during the pandemic. A study conducted by <span class="citation" data-cites="yu2020">Yu et al. (2020)</span> on the impact of COVID-19 on the prices of major food products in China found that rice and wheat showed no significant changes in prices after the COVID lockdown, whereas prices of cabbage showed higher volatility.</p>
<p>Among the green and ripe pineapple prices, higher volatility was observed in the prices of green pineapple as compared to ripe pineapple for all the periods—pre-COVID, COVID-post-COVID, and overall. The value of the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Calpha%20+%20%5Cbeta"> term for green pineapple prices was close to one (0.916) during the post-COVID period, which indicated higher volatility in the prices of green pineapple after the lockdown. This could be because the effect of transportation restrictions during the lockdown on green pineapple was greater as it was marketed to North India, whereas mature ripe pineapple was marketed in Kerala and nearby states. In a similar attempt, while studying the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the prices of rice, chilli, and garlic in Indonesia, it was found that due to the government’s different social assistance programs, the impact of COVID-19 on the prices of rice was negligible, whereas the prices of chilli and garlic had decreased due to the pandemic. The study also found that the effect of COVID-19 on the prices of horticultural products was higher as compared to that on the prices of food grains <span class="citation" data-cites="zahraturrahmi2021">(Zahraturrahmi et al. 2021)</span>.</p>

Figure&nbsp;2: Volatility clustering in daily prices of green and ripe pineapple during pre-COVID, COVID-post-COVID, and overall periods.
</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The Figure&nbsp;2 indicated that there was volatility in the prices of pineapple. But the volatility was more prominent during the COVID-post-COVID period. A lowest price of Rs.10 per kg was realized during the COVID period and it recovered gradually to Rs.60 per kg during the post-COVID period. According to Pineapple Growers Association Kerala, the farm gate price had come down to Rs.10 per kg compared to Rs.40 in the previous year due to lockdown <span class="citation" data-cites="kumar2020">(Kumar 2020)</span>. Thus, the pineapple farmers were in distress and they were unable to pay off their debts. There was also a report of farmer suicide due to financial losses in pineapple cultivation <span class="citation" data-cites="gok2020b">(Government of Kerala 2020b)</span>.</p>
<p>In a similar attempt, <span class="citation" data-cites="kaur2021">(Kaur 2021)</span> in her study observed persistence of volatility in the prices of cereals, pulses and fruits before and after COVID-19. <span class="citation" data-cites="arumugam2020">(Arumugam, Kanagavalli, and Manida 2020)</span> revealed that the problem of labour shortage caused by a fear of viral transmission led to the wastage of harvested commodities, primarily fruits and vegetables, and also demand reduction of produce in the market. In a study conducted by <span class="citation" data-cites="pandya2021">(Pandya et al. 2021)</span>, the prices of all agricultural items dropped by about 70 percent due to a rapid drop in demand and an excess supply of farm products. According to <span class="citation" data-cites="hossain2020">(Hossain et al. 2020)</span>, COVID-19 not only affected physical health but also affected the mental health of farmers.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>The present study highlights the significant volatility in pineapple prices across pre-COVID, COVID-post-COVID, and overall periods in the Vazhakulam market. Results from the GARCH(1,1) model indicated that both green and ripe pineapple prices experienced persistent volatility, with a pronounced increase during the COVID-post-COVID period. This was evident from the higher <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Calpha%20+%20%5Cbeta"> values observed, especially for green pineapple, suggesting a strong memory in the price volatility process during this period.</p>
<p>Several factors contributed to this heightened volatility. The COVID lockdowns imposed transport and logistics constraints and disrupted supply chains which caused a temporary collapse in market demand. This was reflected in steep price drops, with the price of pineapple falling as low as Rs 10 per kg during the lockdown, as reported by the Pineapple Growers Association <span class="citation" data-cites="kumar2020">(Kumar 2020)</span>. The inability to harvest or transport produce due to labour shortages further aggravated the situation <span class="citation" data-cites="arumugam2020">(Arumugam, Kanagavalli, and Manida 2020)</span>.</p>
<p>The findings are consistent with similar studies on other horticultural commodities. <span class="citation" data-cites="kaur2021">(Kaur 2021)</span> found continued volatility in food prices post-COVID, and <span class="citation" data-cites="pandya2021">(Pandya et al. 2021)</span> noted an average price drop of 70% in farm produce during the early pandemic phase. Moreover, the psychological and financial stress induced by the pandemic led to cases of farmer distress and suicide, further underlining the socioeconomic impact <span class="citation" data-cites="hossain2020">(Hossain et al. 2020)</span>.</p>
<p>It was also evident that green pineapple prices were more volatile than ripe ones, potentially due to their greater dependence on inter-state transport, especially to North Indian markets. These insights underscore the vulnerability of perishable commodity sectors to external shocks and reinforce the need for effective price risk management, timely market intelligence, and supportive agricultural policy interventions.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Pineapple cultivation remains a remunerative agricultural activity for many farmers in Kerala, particularly because it is one of the major fruit crops transported from the state to other parts of India. This study examined the price volatility in the Vazhakulam pineapple market during the pre-COVID, COVID-post-COVID, and overall periods. Findings revealed that pineapple farmers in Kerala have historically faced frequent price fluctuations, with significantly heightened volatility observed during the COVID-post-COVID period. This increase was primarily attributed to transportation restrictions and a fall in market demand due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>These results have important implications for policymakers. To stabilize the pineapple market, there is a need to develop more robust price risk management mechanisms. Although the Government of Kerala has fixed a base price of Rs 15 per kg for pineapple <span class="citation" data-cites="gok2020b">(Government of Kerala 2020b)</span>, the study found the average cost of production to be Rs 17.33 per kg. Therefore, it is recommended that the base price be revised to at least Rs 20–22 per kg to ensure profitability. The findings highlight the need for targeted policy support and risk management strategies to stabilize pineapple marketsin Kerala and protect farmer livelihoods during times of crisis.</p>

<h2 data-number="1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>The yardlong bean is one of the most important leguminous vegetables in Asia. Also known as the asparagus bean, string bean, snake bean, or snake pea, it was originally cultivated in West Africa and is now widely grown throughout Southeast Asia—including Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand—where it can be cultivated year-round. In India, it has been known since Vedic times <span class="citation" data-cites="benchasri2012evaluation">(Benchasri, Bairaman, and Nualsri 2012)</span>.</p>
<p>Typically harvested while still young, the yardlong bean is consumed as a green vegetable. It is an annual plant characterized by rapid growth, especially when supported by a trellis. Both tall and short climbing types exist. A member of the Fabaceae family, the plant features twining, delicate stems with a tenacious root system. It blooms in mid-summer, producing pairs of large white or purple flowers. Once pollinated, these flowers develop into slender, dark green beans that can grow up to 12 inches in just a few days. Mature beans can reach lengths of up to three feet, turning pale green and swelling as the red or black seeds ripen.</p>
<p>The yardlong bean also contributes to soil fertility by fixing atmospheric nitrogen through nodules on its roots. It is often referred to as the “poor man’s meat” because its pods are not only rich in protein (23–32% of seed weight) but also contain essential amino acids like lysine and tryptophan, as well as significant levels of folic acid, vitamin B, and other critical micronutrients <span class="citation" data-cites="peyrano2016physicochemical">(Peyrano, Speroni, and Avanza 2016)</span>. As such, it serves as a key dietary staple for many of the poorest populations in developing countries.</p>
<p>Despite its nutritional and agricultural importance, relatively little breeding work has been conducted on this crop. The development of high-yielding, stress-tolerant varieties could significantly boost its cultivation and productivity. However, as a predominantly self-pollinated crop, studies on gene action in yardlong bean remain limited. This study aims to identify gene action governing yield-related traits, which will help inform new breeding strategies to enhance crop improvement efforts.</p>

<p>The genetic material used in the present study consisted of hybrid (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F_1">) plants derived from three promising crosses, along with their six respective parents. The selected parental inbred lines were chosen based solely on differences in yield-related traits. Three single-cross <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F_1"> hybrids were developed using parents with contrasting characteristics.</p>
<p>The three most promising hybrids, based on yield performance and disease resistance from a previous study, were selected for further evaluation. The <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F_1"> hybrids were backcrossed to their respective parents to generate backcross (BC) generations. Simultaneously, the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F_1"> hybrids were self-pollinated to produce the corresponding <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F_2"> populations.</p>
<p>Generation mean analysis was conducted using eighteen populations in total: the three <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F_1">s, their six parents, six backcross generations, and three <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F_2"> populations. The experiment was laid out in a randomized block design (RBD) with three replications in the College of Agriculture, Vellayani during Summer 2004. Standard crop management practices were followed throughout the study. Observations on yield and yield-related traits were recorded from 10 plants each for the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F_1">, parent, and backcross generations. For the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F_2"> populations, data were collected from 30 plants per cross.</p>

<p>The six-parameter model developed by Hayman <span class="citation" data-cites="hayman1958separation">(Hayman 1958)</span> was used for generation mean analysis. The four scaling tests (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C">, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D">) were determined according to the method suggested by Mather <span class="citation" data-cites="mather1949biometrical">(Mather 1949)</span>. These different scales are computed using simple linear combinations as given in Equation&nbsp;1 to Equation&nbsp;4.</p>

<p>Generation mean analysis is a statistical technique used to estimate the components of variance and determine the predominant type of gene action controlling important traits in a crop species. This analysis assists in selecting appropriate breeding strategies for the improvement of various quantitative traits.</p>
<p>Generation mean analysis was conducted for three cowpea crosses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cross 1: VS86 × VS132<br>
</li>
<li>Cross 2: Kozhicode Local-2 × Thiruvananthapuram Local-12<br>
</li>
<li>Cross 3: Thiruvananthapuram Local-9 × Thiruvananthapuram Local-12</li>
</ul>
<p>The mean values of the six generations (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P_1">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P_2">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F_1">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F_2">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B_1">, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B_2">) for each cross are presented in Table&nbsp;1. Among them, the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F_1"> of Cross 3 flowered the earliest (38.4 days), while Cross 1 was harvested the earliest (58.1 days). The <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F_1"> of Cross 2 exhibited the highest pod yield per plant (454.91 g), whereas the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B_2"> generation of Cross 1 recorded the maximum yield overall (485.67 g).</p>
<p>The scale values and genetic component estimates for the various traits across the three crosses are shown in Table&nbsp;2 and Table&nbsp;3. The estimated mean effect (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m">) was highly significant for traits such as days to flowering, pod length, pod breadth, pods per plant, pod yield per plant, and root weight across all crosses, indicating that these traits are quantitatively inherited.</p>
<p>As shown in Table&nbsp;3, significant negative dominant effects (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?h">) were observed for pod length and pod yield per plant, suggesting that these traits are more prominently expressed in homozygous individuals.</p>

<p>The significance of scales <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B"> for most traits indicates that the simple additive-dominance model is inadequate for explaining their inheritance, as reported by <span class="citation" data-cites="thakare2016genetic">Thakare et al. (2016)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="kudiabor2023gene">Kudiabor et al. (2023)</span>. Non-allelic interactions, alongside additive and dominance components, were observed in the expression of several traits, similar to the findings of <span class="citation" data-cites="edematie2021inheritance">Edematie et al. (2021)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="akombo2021">Akombo et al. (2021)</span>.</p>
<p>Significant additive × additive (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i">) interactions were found for pod length, pods per plant, pod yield per plant, and root weight, suggesting complementary or duplicate epistasis. Non-allelic interactions were also evident in traits like days to first flowering. Here, additive effects were highly significant, and additive × dominance (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j">) interactions were also observed. Dominance × dominance (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?l">) interactions acted in a favorable negative direction in all hybrids. Similar epistatic interactions for early flowering and duplicate epistasis for traits like days to 90% pod maturity in cowpea were reported by <span class="citation" data-cites="patel2013">Patel et al. (2013)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="thakare2016genetic">Thakare et al. (2016)</span>, and <span class="citation" data-cites="owusu2022generation">Owusu et al. (2022)</span>.</p>
<p>These findings imply that earliness in cowpea could be improved through hybridization followed by the selection of promising recombinants in later generations, particularly in crosses governed by duplicate epistasis.</p>
<p>The significance of scales <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D"> for pod length further supports the involvement of dominance × dominance and additive × additive interactions in this trait. Significant additive (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?d">) and dominance (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?h">) effects for pod length were also reported by <span class="citation" data-cites="rashwan2010estimation">Rashwan (2010)</span> and Thakare et al.&nbsp;(2013).</p>
<p>Among epistatic interactions, dominance × dominance (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?l">), additive × additive (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i">), and additive × dominance (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j">) were observed in different crosses. In the case of pod weight, both dominance effects and additive × additive interactions were significant but acted in a negative direction. However, the positive significance of dominance × dominance interactions suggests that hybridization followed by selection would be an effective strategy for improving this trait.</p>
<p>All three types of digenic interactions (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?l">) were observed for pods per plant. While additive × dominance (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j">) was positive and significant, both dominance (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?h">) and additive × additive (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i">) effects acted in the negative direction. The presence of non-allelic interactions for this trait aligns with the findings of <span class="citation" data-cites="thakare2016genetic">Thakare et al. (2016)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="edematie2021inheritance">Edematie et al. (2021)</span>. Significant positive dominance (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?h">) and dominance × dominance (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?l">) interactions suggest the presence of complementary epistasis. In contrast, the negative significance of dominance × dominance (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?l">) for pod yield per plant implies limited potential for improvement through heterosis breeding for this trait.</p>
<p>The direction of dominance and dominance × dominance interactions indicated duplicate gene action in the expression of traits such as pod weight, pod breadth, pods per cluster, seeds per pod, root weight per plant, and days to first harvest. Dominance was found to play a role in all traits, especially pod length, as reported by <span class="citation" data-cites="santos2024genetic">Santos et al. (2024)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="pallavi2019generation">Pallavi, Singh, and Chaudhary (2019)</span>.</p>
<p>Both additive × additive and dominance × dominance interactions were significant for root weight per plant, while the insignificance of all four scale tests (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D">) for traits like pod breadth, pods per cluster, seeds per pod, days to first harvest, primary branches per plant, and 100-seed weight indicates the adequacy of the additive-dominance model for these traits, and the absence of epistasis. Nonetheless, duplicate epistasis for most yield-related traits in cowpea was previously reported by <span class="citation" data-cites="shinde2021generation">Shinde et al. (2021)</span>.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The generation mean analysis conducted on three cowpea crosses revealed complex genetic control for several important agronomic traits. While the mean effect was highly significant for all key traits, indicating their quantitative nature, the inadequacy of the simple additive-dominance model—evidenced by significant scale tests and the presence of epistasis—highlights the role of non-allelic gene interactions in trait inheritance. Additive × additive, additive × dominance, and dominance × dominance interactions were frequently observed across traits such as pod length, pod yield per plant, pods per plant, and root weight. The predominance of duplicate and complementary epistasis suggests that hybridization followed by selection in segregating generations would be an effective breeding strategy for improving these traits.</p>
<p>Traits like pod breadth, seeds per pod, and 100-seed weight showed no significant epistasis, indicating that selection based on the additive-dominance model may suffice for their improvement. Conversely, traits influenced by significant non-additive gene actions, such as pod yield and pod weight, may benefit more from recombination breeding approaches. Overall, this study underscores the importance of understanding the underlying gene action for designing appropriate breeding strategies. The insights gained provide a valuable foundation for improving yield and related traits in cowpea through targeted hybridization and selection efforts.</p>

<p>Statistical analysis serves as the backbone of scientific research, especially in disciplines like agriculture, where field experiments, survey data, and observational studies generate complex datasets. Despite the increasing emphasis on data-driven decision-making in agricultural research, many students, early-career researchers, and practitioners find themselves at a disadvantage when it comes to performing rigorous statistical analyses. The process is often hindered by a combination of factors: the steep learning curve associated with programming languages such as R and Python, the fragmented nature of statistical learning resources, and the lack of user-friendly tools tailored to agricultural research contexts.</p>
<p>While R and Python are powerful, flexible, and widely adopted in academic and professional settings, their command-line interfaces and syntax-heavy operations can be challenging for those without formal training in statistics or computer programming. Beginners frequently struggle with package selection, data cleaning, model specification, and interpretation of results. Furthermore, existing statistical software either lacks the flexibility and transparency of open-source tools or comes with licensing restrictions and high costs that limit accessibility in resource-constrained settings, particularly in developing countries.</p>
<p>In addition, agricultural research involves domain-specific needs such as handling experimental designs (e.g., CRD, RBD, split-plot), analyzing agronomic trials, processing survey data with appropriate sampling designs, and interpreting interactions between multiple environmental and genetic factors. Traditional statistical packages are not always well-adapted to these specific requirements, leaving researchers to either customize solutions on their own or consult specialists — both of which can delay or compromise the analytical workflow.</p>
<p>To bridge this gap, we developed RAISINS (R and AI Solutions for INferential Statistics) — a web-based platform designed to simplify and democratize statistical analysis for agricultural research. RAISINS integrates the power of R, Python, and AI-driven assistance within an intuitive interface that eliminates the need for code-based interaction. By abstracting complex syntax and offering guided, step-by-step workflows for data upload, analysis, visualization, and interpretation, the platform empowers users to focus on scientific inquiry rather than technical execution.</p>
<p>Built on open-source technologies and scalable cloud infrastructure, RAISINS provides modules for commonly used statistical methods — including descriptive analysis, hypothesis testing, regression models, design of experiments, multi environmental trials, and more — while incorporating AI tools that assist in data summarization, analytical suggestions, and natural language explanations of results. This makes it an ideal solution for students, researchers, extension personnel, and educators engaged in agricultural and allied sciences. RAISINS can be accessed online through its official web portal at https://www.raisins.live/.</p>

<section id="sec-packages" class="level3" data-number="2.2">
<h3 data-number="2.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-packages"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Packages and Libraries</h3>
<p>RAISINS integrates a comprehensive ecosystem of open-source R and Python packages to deliver its core functionalities, encompassing statistical modeling, data visualization, artificial intelligence, and interactive web-based deployment. These packages support the platform’s goal of offering high-level statistical capabilities through an accessible and intuitive interface, particularly beneficial for students and researchers in agricultural sciences.</p>
<p>The R-based architecture of RAISINS is built around the <code>shiny</code> framework <span class="citation" data-cites="shiny">(Chang et al. 2024)</span>, which enables the development of dynamic, browser-accessible applications. Data manipulation tasks are performed using <code>dplyr</code> <span class="citation" data-cites="dplyr">(Wickham et al. 2024)</span>, <code>tidyr</code>, and <code>data.table</code>, while data visualization is implemented through <code>ggplot2</code> <span class="citation" data-cites="ggplot2">(Wickham 2023)</span>, along with complementary packages such as <code>ggthemes</code>, <code>plotly</code> <span class="citation" data-cites="plotly">(Sievert 2023)</span>, and <code>ggpattern</code>. For statistical analysis relevant to agricultural experiments and general inference, the platform employs packages including <code>agricolae</code> <span class="citation" data-cites="agricolae">(Mendiburu 2020)</span>, <code>broom</code> <span class="citation" data-cites="broom">(Robinson and Hayes 2024)</span>, <code>effectsize</code>, <code>lsr</code>, <code>car</code>, <code>phia</code>, and <code>FactoMineR</code> <span class="citation" data-cites="FactoMineR">(Husson et al. 2020)</span>.

The presentation and export of analytical results are managed through tools like <code>rmarkdown</code>, <code>kableExtra</code>, and <code>formattable</code>, ensuring professional and structured output for reports and publications.</p>
<p>The <code>reticulate</code><span class="citation" data-cites="reticulate">(Allaire et al. 2024)</span> package serves as a bridge between R and Python, allowing both languages to be used seamlessly within the same analytical workflow. In RAISINS, reticulate enables the platform to call Python functions, use Python libraries, and exchange data objects between R and Python environments. This integration allows the platform to combine R’s interactive capabilities with Python’s strengths in machine learning, statistical modeling, and AI-driven tasks, thereby enhancing both flexibility and functionality.</p>
<p>Python libraries are used to extend the platform’s analytical and AI-driven features. Packages such as <code>pandas</code> <span class="citation" data-cites="pandas">(The pandas development team 2024)</span> and <code>numpy</code> <span class="citation" data-cites="numpy">(Harris et al. 2020)</span> are employed for efficient data handling, while <code>matplotlib</code> and <code>seaborn</code> support graphical representations. For machine learning and statistical modeling, the platform uses <code>scikit-learn</code> <span class="citation" data-cites="scikit-learn">(Pedregosa et al. 2011)</span> and <code>statsmodels</code> <span class="citation" data-cites="statsmodels">(Seabold and Perktold 2010)</span>. The <code>openai</code> package enables the integration of language models, facilitating intelligent assistance and automated content generation within the platform.</p>
<p>All R and Python packages used in RAISINS are well-maintained, community-supported, and widely recognized within academic and applied data science contexts. Each library is carefully selected based on its performance, stability, and relevance to agricultural research workflows. Modules are thoroughly reviewed by subject-matter experts to ensure methodological accuracy and pedagogical effectiveness, thereby maintaining the platform’s commitment to reproducibility, transparency, and educational value.</p>
