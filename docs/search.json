    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe yardlong bean is one of the most important leguminous vegetables in Asia. Also known as the asparagus bean, string bean, snake bean, or snake pea, it was originally cultivated in West Africa and is now widely grown throughout Southeast Asia—including Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand—where it can be cultivated year-round. In India, it has been known since Vedic times (Benchasri, Bairaman, and Nualsri 2012).\nTypically harvested while still young, the yardlong bean is consumed as a green vegetable. It is an annual plant characterized by rapid growth, especially when supported by a trellis. Both tall and short climbing types exist. A member of the Fabaceae family, the plant features twining, delicate stems with a tenacious root system. It blooms in mid-summer, producing pairs of large white or purple flowers. Once pollinated, these flowers develop into slender, dark green beans that can grow up to 12 inches in just a few days. Mature beans can reach lengths of up to three feet, turning pale green and swelling as the red or black seeds ripen.\nThe yardlong bean also contributes to soil fertility by fixing atmospheric nitrogen through nodules on its roots. It is often referred to as the “poor man’s meat” because its pods are not only rich in protein (23–32% of seed weight) but also contain essential amino acids like lysine and tryptophan, as well as significant levels of folic acid, vitamin B, and other critical micronutrients (Peyrano, Speroni, and Avanza 2016). As such, it serves as a key dietary staple for many of the poorest populations in developing countries.\nDespite its nutritional and agricultural importance, relatively little breeding work has been conducted on this crop. The development of high-yielding, stress-tolerant varieties could significantly boost its cultivation and productivity. However, as a predominantly self-pollinated crop, studies on gene action in yardlong bean remain limited. This study aims to identify gene action governing yield-related traits, which will help inform new breeding strategies to enhance crop improvement efforts.",

    "text": "2 Materials and methods\nThe genetic material used in the present study consisted of hybrid (\\(F_1\\)) plants derived from three promising crosses, along with their six respective parents. The selected parental inbred lines were chosen based solely on differences in yield-related traits. Three single-cross \\(F_1\\) hybrids were developed using parents with contrasting characteristics.\nThe three most promising hybrids, based on yield performance and disease resistance from a previous study, were selected for further evaluation. The \\(F_1\\) hybrids were backcrossed to their respective parents to generate backcross (BC) generations. Simultaneously, the \\(F_1\\) hybrids were self-pollinated to produce the corresponding \\(F_2\\) populations.\nGeneration mean analysis was conducted using eighteen populations in total: the three \\(F_1\\)s, their six parents, six backcross generations, and three \\(F_2\\) populations. The experiment was laid out in a randomized block design (RBD) with three replications in the College of Agriculture, Vellayani during Summer 2004. Standard crop management practices were followed throughout the study. Observations on yield and yield-related traits were recorded from 10 plants each for the \\(F_1\\), parent, and backcross generations. For the \\(F_2\\) populations, data were collected from 30 plants per cross.\n\n2.1 Generation Mean Analysis\nThe six-parameter model developed by Hayman (Hayman 1958) was used for generation mean analysis. The four scaling tests (\\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\)) were determined according to the method suggested by Mather (Mather 1949). These different scales are computed using simple linear combinations as given in Equation 1 to Equation 4.\n\\[A = 2\\overline{B_1} - \\overline{F_1} - P_1 = 0 \\tag{1}\\]\n\\[B = 2\\overline{B_2} - \\overline{F_1} - \\overline{P_2} = 0 \\tag{2}\\]\n\\[C = 4\\overline{F_2} - 2\\overline{F_1} - \\overline{P_1} - \\overline{P_2} = 0 \\tag{3}\\]\n\\[D = 4\\overline{F_3} - 2\\overline{F_2} - \\overline{P_1} - \\overline{P_2} = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad D = 2\\overline{F_2} - \\overline{B_2} - \\overline{B_1} \\tag{4}\\]\nWhere \\(P_1\\), \\(P_2\\), \\(F_1\\), \\(F_2\\), \\(B_1\\), and \\(B_2\\) are means of different generations, respectively. The variances of the quantities \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) were calculated from the respective variances of different generations as given from Equation 5 to Equation 8.\n\\[V_A = 4V_{\\overline{B_1}} + V_{\\overline{F_1}} + V_{\\overline{P_1}} \\tag{5}\\]\n\\[V_B = 4V_{\\overline{B_2}} + V_{\\overline{F_1}} + V_{\\overline{P_2}} \\tag{6}\\]\n\\[V_C = 16V_{\\overline{F_2}} + 4V_{\\overline{F_1}} + V_{\\overline{P_1}} + V_{\\overline{P_2}} \\tag{7}\\]\n\\[V_D = 16V_{\\overline{F_3}} + 4V_{\\overline{F_2}} + V_{\\overline{P_1}} + V_{\\overline{P_2}} \\tag{8}\\]\nWhere, \\(V_{P_1}\\) is the variance of the individuals within the \\(P_1\\) family; \\(V_{\\overline{P_1}}\\) is the variance of \\({\\overline{P_1}}\\) (mean of the \\(P_1\\) family); and \\(\\overline{V_{P_1}} = \\frac{V_{P_1}}{N}\\), where \\(N\\) is the number of individuals observed in the \\(P_1\\) family.\nThe standard error of \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) is calculated by taking the square root of their respective variances. The corresponding \\(t\\) values are computed by dividing the values of \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) by their respective standard errors.\nSignificance of any of the four scales indicates the inadequacy of the additive-dominance model and the presence of epistasis. If the calculated \\(t\\) values are found to be significant, the presence of specific types of epistasis is confirmed.\nThe significance of either one or both of the \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) scales indicates the presence of all three types of digenic interaction, namely additive × additive, additive × dominance, and dominance × dominance. The significance of scale \\(C\\) indicates the presence of dominance × dominance type of non-allelic interaction, while the significance of scale \\(D\\) denotes additive × additive type of gene action. When both \\(C\\) and \\(D\\) scales are significant, it suggests the presence of both additive × additive and dominance × dominance types of gene interaction.\n\n\n2.2 Estimation of gene effects\nSignificance of any of the scales \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\) and \\(D\\) will indicate the presence of epistatic interaction or digenic interactions. Hayman and Jinks and Jones gave a 6 parameter model for the estimation of various genetic components. The six genetic parameters were estimated using Equation 9 to Equation 14.\n\\[m = \\overline{F_2} \\tag{9}\\]\n\\[d = \\overline{B_1} - \\overline{B_2} \\tag{10}\\]\n\\[h = \\overline{F_1} - 4\\overline{F_2} - \\frac{\\overline{P_1}}{2}- \\frac{\\overline{P_2}}{2} + 2\\overline{B_1} + 2\\overline{B_2} \\tag{11}\\]\n\\[i = 2\\overline{B_1} + 2\\overline{B_2} - 4\\overline{F_2} \\tag{12}\\]\n\\[j = \\overline{B_1} - \\frac{\\overline{P_1}}{2} - \\overline{B_2} + \\frac{\\overline{P_2}}{2} \\tag{13}\\]\n\\[l = \\overline{P_1} + \\overline{P_2} + 2\\overline{F_1} + 4\\overline{F_2} - 4\\overline{B_1} - 4\\overline{B_2} \\tag{14}\\]\nWhere \\(m\\) = mean; \\(d\\) = additive effect; \\(h\\) = dominance effect; \\(i\\) = additive x additive gene interaction; \\(j\\) = additive x dominance gene interaction; \\(l\\) = dominance x dominance gene interaction.\nThe variances of the six genetic parameters were calculated using Equation 15 to Equation 20\n\\[(m) = V_{\\overline{F_2}} \\tag{15}\\]\n\\[V(d) = V_{\\overline{B_1}} + V_{\\overline{B_2}} \\tag{16}\\]\n\\[V(h) = V_{\\overline{F_1}} + 16V_{\\overline{F_2}} + \\frac{V_{\\overline{P_1}}}{4} + \\frac{V_{\\overline{P_2}}}{4} + 4V_{\\overline{B_1}} + 4V_{\\overline{B_2}} \\tag{17}\\]\n\\[V(i) = 4V_{\\overline{B_1}} + 4V_{\\overline{B_2}} + 16V_{\\overline{F_2}} \\tag{18}\\]\n\\[V(j) = V_{\\overline{B_1}} + \\frac{V_{\\overline{P_1}}}{4} + V_{\\overline{B_2}} + \\frac{V_{\\overline{P_2}}}{4} \\tag{19}\\]\n\\[V(l) = 4V_{\\overline{P_1}} + 4V_{\\overline{P_2}} + 4V_{\\overline{F_1}} + 16V_{\\overline{F_2}} + 16V_{\\overline{B_1}} + 16V_{\\overline{B_2}} \\tag{20}\\]",

    "text": "3 Results\nGeneration mean analysis is a statistical technique used to estimate the components of variance and determine the predominant type of gene action controlling important traits in a crop species. This analysis assists in selecting appropriate breeding strategies for the improvement of various quantitative traits.\nGeneration mean analysis was conducted for three cowpea crosses:\n\nCross 1: VS86 × VS132\n\nCross 2: Kozhicode Local-2 × Thiruvananthapuram Local-12\n\nCross 3: Thiruvananthapuram Local-9 × Thiruvananthapuram Local-12\n\nThe mean values of the six generations (\\(P_1\\), \\(P_2\\), \\(F_1\\), \\(F_2\\), \\(B_1\\), and \\(B_2\\)) for each cross are presented in Table 1. Among them, the \\(F_1\\) of Cross 3 flowered the earliest (38.4 days), while Cross 1 was harvested the earliest (58.1 days). The \\(F_1\\) of Cross 2 exhibited the highest pod yield per plant (454.91 g), whereas the \\(B_2\\) generation of Cross 1 recorded the maximum yield overall (485.67 g).\nThe scale values and genetic component estimates for the various traits across the three crosses are shown in Table 2 and Table 3. The estimated mean effect (\\(m\\)) was highly significant for traits such as days to flowering, pod length, pod breadth, pods per plant, pod yield per plant, and root weight across all crosses, indicating that these traits are quantitatively inherited.\nAs shown in Table 3, significant negative dominant effects (\\(h\\)) were observed for pod length and pod yield per plant, suggesting that these traits are more prominently expressed in homozygous individuals.\n\n\n\nTable 1: Generation mean values of the three crosses in yardlong

    "text": "Discussion\nThe significance of scales \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) for most traits indicates that the simple additive-dominance model is inadequate for explaining their inheritance, as reported by Thakare et al. (2016) and Kudiabor et al. (2023). Non-allelic interactions, alongside additive and dominance components, were observed in the expression of several traits, similar to the findings of Edematie et al. (2021) and Akombo et al. (2021).\nSignificant additive × additive (\\(i\\)) interactions were found for pod length, pods per plant, pod yield per plant, and root weight, suggesting complementary or duplicate epistasis. Non-allelic interactions were also evident in traits like days to first flowering. Here, additive effects were highly significant, and additive × dominance (\\(j\\)) interactions were also observed. Dominance × dominance (\\(l\\)) interactions acted in a favorable negative direction in all hybrids. Similar epistatic interactions for early flowering and duplicate epistasis for traits like days to 90% pod maturity in cowpea were reported by Patel et al. (2013), Thakare et al. (2016), and Owusu et al. (2022).\nThese findings imply that earliness in cowpea could be improved through hybridization followed by the selection of promising recombinants in later generations, particularly in crosses governed by duplicate epistasis.\nThe significance of scales \\(C\\) and \\(D\\) for pod length further supports the involvement of dominance × dominance and additive × additive interactions in this trait. Significant additive (\\(d\\)) and dominance (\\(h\\)) effects for pod length were also reported by Rashwan (2010) and Thakare et al. (2013).\nAmong epistatic interactions, dominance × dominance (\\(l\\)), additive × additive (\\(i\\)), and additive × dominance (\\(j\\)) were observed in different crosses. In the case of pod weight, both dominance effects and additive × additive interactions were significant but acted in a negative direction. However, the positive significance of dominance × dominance interactions suggests that hybridization followed by selection would be an effective strategy for improving this trait.\nAll three types of digenic interactions (\\(i\\), \\(j\\), \\(l\\)) were observed for pods per plant. While additive × dominance (\\(j\\)) was positive and significant, both dominance (\\(h\\)) and additive × additive (\\(i\\)) effects acted in the negative direction. The presence of non-allelic interactions for this trait aligns with the findings of Thakare et al. (2016) and Edematie et al. (2021). Significant positive dominance (\\(h\\)) and dominance × dominance (\\(l\\)) interactions suggest the presence of complementary epistasis. In contrast, the negative significance of dominance × dominance (\\(l\\)) for pod yield per plant implies limited potential for improvement through heterosis breeding for this trait.\nThe direction of dominance and dominance × dominance interactions indicated duplicate gene action in the expression of traits such as pod weight, pod breadth, pods per cluster, seeds per pod, root weight per plant, and days to first harvest. Dominance was found to play a role in all traits, especially pod length, as reported by Santos et al. (2024) and Pallavi, Singh, and Chaudhary (2019).\nBoth additive × additive and dominance × dominance interactions were significant for root weight per plant, while the insignificance of all four scale tests (\\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), \\(D\\)) for traits like pod breadth, pods per cluster, seeds per pod, days to first harvest, primary branches per plant, and 100-seed weight indicates the adequacy of the additive-dominance model for these traits, and the absence of epistasis. Nonetheless, duplicate epistasis for most yield-related traits in cowpea was previously reported by Shinde et al. (2021).",

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nThe generation mean analysis conducted on three cowpea crosses revealed complex genetic control for several important agronomic traits. While the mean effect was highly significant for all key traits, indicating their quantitative nature, the inadequacy of the simple additive-dominance model—evidenced by significant scale tests and the presence of epistasis—highlights the role of non-allelic gene interactions in trait inheritance. Additive × additive, additive × dominance, and dominance × dominance interactions were frequently observed across traits such as pod length, pod yield per plant, pods per plant, and root weight. The predominance of duplicate and complementary epistasis suggests that hybridization followed by selection in segregating generations would be an effective breeding strategy for improving these traits.\nTraits like pod breadth, seeds per pod, and 100-seed weight showed no significant epistasis, indicating that selection based on the additive-dominance model may suffice for their improvement. Conversely, traits influenced by significant non-additive gene actions, such as pod yield and pod weight, may benefit more from recombination breeding approaches. Overall, this study underscores the importance of understanding the underlying gene action for designing appropriate breeding strategies. The insights gained provide a valuable foundation for improving yield and related traits in cowpea through targeted hybridization and selection efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcknowledgments\n\n\n\nThe first author gratefully acknowledges the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Government of India, for awarding the Junior Research Fellowship (JRF) in support of the Ph.D. programme.",

    "text": "1 Introduction\nStatistical analysis serves as the backbone of scientific research, especially in disciplines like agriculture, where field experiments, survey data, and observational studies generate complex datasets. Despite the increasing emphasis on data-driven decision-making in agricultural research, many students, early-career researchers, and practitioners find themselves at a disadvantage when it comes to performing rigorous statistical analyses. The process is often hindered by a combination of factors: the steep learning curve associated with programming languages such as R and Python, the fragmented nature of statistical learning resources, and the lack of user-friendly tools tailored to agricultural research contexts.\nWhile R and Python are powerful, flexible, and widely adopted in academic and professional settings, their command-line interfaces and syntax-heavy operations can be challenging for those without formal training in statistics or computer programming. Beginners frequently struggle with package selection, data cleaning, model specification, and interpretation of results. Furthermore, existing statistical software either lacks the flexibility and transparency of open-source tools or comes with licensing restrictions and high costs that limit accessibility in resource-constrained settings, particularly in developing countries.\nIn addition, agricultural research involves domain-specific needs such as handling experimental designs (e.g., CRD, RBD, split-plot), analyzing agronomic trials, processing survey data with appropriate sampling designs, and interpreting interactions between multiple environmental and genetic factors. Traditional statistical packages are not always well-adapted to these specific requirements, leaving researchers to either customize solutions on their own or consult specialists — both of which can delay or compromise the analytical workflow.\nTo bridge this gap, we developed RAISINS (R and AI Solutions for INferential Statistics) — a web-based platform designed to simplify and democratize statistical analysis for agricultural research. RAISINS integrates the power of R, Python, and AI-driven assistance within an intuitive interface that eliminates the need for code-based interaction. By abstracting complex syntax and offering guided, step-by-step workflows for data upload, analysis, visualization, and interpretation, the platform empowers users to focus on scientific inquiry rather than technical execution.\nBuilt on open-source technologies and scalable cloud infrastructure, RAISINS provides modules for commonly used statistical methods — including descriptive analysis, hypothesis testing, regression models, design of experiments, multi environmental trials, and more — while incorporating AI tools that assist in data summarization, analytical suggestions, and natural language explanations of results. This makes it an ideal solution for students, researchers, extension personnel, and educators engaged in agricultural and allied sciences. RAISINS can be accessed online through its official web portal at https://www.raisins.live/.\nIn this paper, we present the design, features, and use-cases of RAISINS, and demonstrate how it addresses the unique challenges faced in agricultural data analysis by offering an accessible, robust, and intelligent statistical platform.",

    "text": "2 Materials and methods\n\n2.1 Platform architecture and module validation\nRAISINS is a modular cloud-hosted, web-based platform that integrates statistical computing, artificial intelligence, and modern pedagogical design to serve agricultural researchers and students. Built using R, Python, and OpenAI APIs, RAISINS is deployed via Posit Connect Cloud (https://connect.posit.cloud/), enabling browser-based access without requiring any local software installation. The RAISINS platform is modular and each statistical tool within is aligned with the theoretical underpinnings found in globally recognized academic literature.\nAll modules in RAISINS have been peer-reviewed by domain experts, including statisticians specializing in design of experiments, genetics, and social science research. This ensures both methodological rigor and instructional clarity.\nTable 1 presents the major analytical domains addressed by RAISINS, the foundational academic references supporting each module domain, organized by area of application.\n\n\n\nTable 1: Foundational literature supporting each RAISINS module domain, organized by area of application.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModule Domain\nTheoretical Foundation\n\n\n\n\nDesign & Analysis of Experiments\nMontgomery (2017) (Montgomery 2017); Gomez & Gomez (1984) (Gomez and Gomez 1984); Das & Giri (2018) (Das and Giri 2018); Searle (1997) (Searle 1997); Dey (1986) (Dey 1986); Cox & Reid (2000) (Cox and Reid 2000); Toutenburg & Shalabh (2009) (Toutenburg and Shalabh 2009); Cochran & Cox (1957) (Cochran and Cox 1957); ; Federer (1985) (Federer 1985)\n\n\nStatistical Genetics\nFalconer & Mackay (1996) (Falconer and Mackay 1996); Lynch & Walsh (1998) (Lynch and Walsh 1998); Dabholkar (1999) (Dabholkar 1999); Gillespie (2004) (Gillespie 2004)\n\n\nSocial Science Research\nBabbie (2020) (Babbie 2020); Bryman (2016) (Bryman 2016); Bhattacherjee (2012) (Bhattacherjee 2012)\n\n\nStatistical Inference and Modeling\nCasella & Berger (2002) (Casella and Berger 2002); Hogg, McKean & Craig (2018) (Hogg, McKean, and Craig 2018); Agresti (2013) (Agresti 2013); Rao (2009) (Rao 2009); Rohatgi (1984) (Rohatgi 1984)\n\n\nData Visualization & Reporting\nTufte (2001) (Tufte 2001); Cleveland (1993) (Cleveland 1993); Few (2009) (Few 2009)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe algorithms and workflows integrated into RAISINS are grounded in established statistical theory, drawing extensively from authoritative texts and peer-reviewed literature. In cases where existing computational implementations were unavailable or insufficient, original algorithms were developed in adherence to rigorous theoretical principles. The platform’s design and interface have been iteratively refined based on user-centered feedback from researchers and educators, ensuring methodological soundness and usability consistent with global standards in scientific research and statistical education.\n\n\n2.2 Packages and Libraries\nRAISINS integrates a comprehensive ecosystem of open-source R and Python packages to deliver its core functionalities, encompassing statistical modeling, data visualization, artificial intelligence, and interactive web-based deployment. These packages support the platform’s goal of offering high-level statistical capabilities through an accessible and intuitive interface, particularly beneficial for students and researchers in agricultural sciences.\nThe R-based architecture of RAISINS is built around the shiny framework (Chang et al. 2024), which enables the development of dynamic, browser-accessible applications. Data manipulation tasks are performed using dplyr (Wickham et al. 2024), tidyr, and data.table, while data visualization is implemented through ggplot2 (Wickham 2023), along with complementary packages such as ggthemes, plotly (Sievert 2023), and ggpattern. For statistical analysis relevant to agricultural experiments and general inference, the platform employs packages including agricolae (Mendiburu 2020), broom (Robinson and Hayes 2024), effectsize, lsr, car, phia, and FactoMineR (Husson et al. 2020). These libraries provide robust support for model fitting, hypothesis testing, effect size estimation, and multivariate analysis.\nTo enhance user interaction and responsiveness, RAISINS integrates several user interface and usability packages, such as shinyWidgets, shinyalert, shinybusy, shinycustomloader, shinyBS, shinythemes, and colourpicker. The presentation and export of analytical results are managed through tools like rmarkdown, kableExtra, and formattable, ensuring professional and structured output for reports and publications.\nThe reticulate(Allaire et al. 2024) package serves as a bridge between R and Python, allowing both languages to be used seamlessly within the same analytical workflow. In RAISINS, reticulate enables the platform to call Python functions, use Python libraries, and exchange data objects between R and Python environments. This integration allows the platform to combine R’s interactive capabilities with Python’s strengths in machine learning, statistical modeling, and AI-driven tasks, thereby enhancing both flexibility and functionality.\nPython libraries are used to extend the platform’s analytical and AI-driven features. Packages such as pandas (The pandas development team 2024) and numpy (Harris et al. 2020) are employed for efficient data handling, while matplotlib and seaborn support graphical representations. For machine learning and statistical modeling, the platform uses scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al. 2011) and statsmodels (Seabold and Perktold 2010). The openai package enables the integration of language models, facilitating intelligent assistance and automated content generation within the platform.\nAll R and Python packages used in RAISINS are well-maintained, community-supported, and widely recognized within academic and applied data science contexts. Each library is carefully selected based on its performance, stability, and relevance to agricultural research workflows. Modules are thoroughly reviewed by subject-matter experts to ensure methodological accuracy and pedagogical effectiveness, thereby maintaining the platform’s commitment to reproducibility, transparency, and educational value.",

    "text": "4 Results\nThe RAISINS platform was developed to address the growing need for accessible, reliable, and AI-enhanced statistical tools tailored to agricultural research. By integrating familiar programming environments with user-friendly interfaces, it aims to bridge the gap between complex statistical methods and researchers’ practical needs.\n\n4.1 Modular structure and user interface design\nAll analytical modules within the RAISINS platform adhere to a standardized structural layout, ensuring a uniform user experience across various statistical tools. Each module features a primary Analysis tab, which serves as the central workspace. This tab contains nested sub-tabs including Analysis.Results, where users configure model parameters and run statistical procedures; Plots and Graphs, which displays dynamic visualizations; AI Interpretation, where OpenAI-assisted textual summaries explain the results in plain language; and, where applicable, a Multivariate tab offering additional multivariate diagnostics and tests. Supplementing the core analysis, additional top-level tabs include Create Data, which enables users to generate CSV-format datasets for custom input; Datasets, which provides curated example datasets for testing and exploration; and User, where authenticated users can access their profile information and session history. For illustration purposes, selected screenshots from the CRD (Completely Randomized Design) module are presented in Figure 2 to demonstrate the consistent tab layout and modular design adopted throughout the platform. A comprehensive module-wise user guide is available at: https://statoberrypapaya.github.io/RAISINS_TUTORIAL/, providing detailed documentation of the functionalities implemented in each component of the RAISINS platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) CRD module main page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Authentication page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Module dashboard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Result tables in Analysis.Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(e) Plots and graphs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(f) AI interpretation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(g) Multivariate analysis window\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(h) Datasets available for testing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: User interface and modular design of the RAISINS platform: screenshots from the CRD Module illustrating the common tab structure across analytical tools.",
