    "text": "1 Introduction\nStatistical analysis serves as the backbone of scientific research, especially in disciplines like agriculture, where field experiments, survey data, and observational studies generate complex datasets. Despite the increasing emphasis on data-driven decision-making in agricultural research, many students, early-career researchers, and practitioners find themselves at a disadvantage when it comes to performing rigorous statistical analyses. The process is often hindered by a combination of factors: the steep learning curve associated with programming languages such as R and Python, the fragmented nature of statistical learning resources, and the lack of user-friendly tools tailored to agricultural research contexts.\nWhile R and Python are powerful, flexible, and widely adopted in academic and professional settings, their command-line interfaces and syntax-heavy operations can be challenging for those without formal training in statistics or computer programming. Beginners frequently struggle with package selection, data cleaning, model specification, and interpretation of results. Furthermore, existing statistical software either lacks the flexibility and transparency of open-source tools or comes with licensing restrictions and high costs that limit accessibility in resource-constrained settings, particularly in developing countries.\nIn addition, agricultural research involves domain-specific needs such as handling experimental designs (e.g., CRD, RBD, split-plot), analyzing agronomic trials, processing survey data with appropriate sampling designs, and interpreting interactions between multiple environmental and genetic factors. Traditional statistical packages are not always well-adapted to these specific requirements, leaving researchers to either customize solutions on their own or consult specialists — both of which can delay or compromise the analytical workflow.\nTo bridge this gap, we developed RAISINS (R and AI Solutions for INferential Statistics) — a web-based platform designed to simplify and democratize statistical analysis for agricultural research. RAISINS integrates the power of R, Python, and AI-driven assistance within an intuitive interface that eliminates the need for code-based interaction. By abstracting complex syntax and offering guided, step-by-step workflows for data upload, analysis, visualization, and interpretation, the platform empowers users to focus on scientific inquiry rather than technical execution.\nBuilt on open-source technologies and scalable cloud infrastructure, RAISINS provides modules for commonly used statistical methods — including descriptive analysis, hypothesis testing, regression models, design of experiments, multi environmental trials, and more — while incorporating AI tools that assist in data summarization, analytical suggestions, and natural language explanations of results. This makes it an ideal solution for students, researchers, extension personnel, and educators engaged in agricultural and allied sciences. RAISINS can be accessed online through its official web portal at https://www.raisins.live/.\nIn this paper, we present the design, features, and use-cases of RAISINS, and demonstrate how it addresses the unique challenges faced in agricultural data analysis by offering an accessible, robust, and intelligent statistical platform."

    "text": "2 Materials and methods\n\n2.1 Platform architecture and module validation\nRAISINS is a modular cloud-hosted, web-based platform that integrates statistical computing, artificial intelligence, and modern pedagogical design to serve agricultural researchers and students. Built using R, Python, and OpenAI APIs, RAISINS is deployed via Posit Connect Cloud (https://connect.posit.cloud/), enabling browser-based access without requiring any local software installation. The RAISINS platform is modular and each statistical tool within is aligned with the theoretical underpinnings found in globally recognized academic literature.\nAll modules in RAISINS have been peer-reviewed by domain experts, including statisticians specializing in design of experiments, genetics, and social science research. This ensures both methodological rigor and instructional clarity.\nTable 1 presents the major analytical domains addressed by RAISINS, the foundational academic references supporting each module domain, organized by area of application.\n\n\n\nTable 1: Foundational literature supporting each RAISINS module domain, organized by area of application.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModule Domain\nTheoretical Foundation\n\n\n\n\nDesign & Analysis of Experiments\nMontgomery (2017) (Montgomery 2017); Gomez & Gomez (1984) (Gomez and Gomez 1984); Das & Giri (2018) (Das and Giri 2018); Searle (1997) (Searle 1997); Dey (1986) (Dey 1986); Cox & Reid (2000) (Cox and Reid 2000); Toutenburg & Shalabh (2009) (Toutenburg and Shalabh 2009); Cochran & Cox (1957) (Cochran and Cox 1957); ; Federer (1985) (Federer 1985)\n\n\nStatistical Genetics\nFalconer & Mackay (1996) (Falconer and Mackay 1996); Lynch & Walsh (1998) (Lynch and Walsh 1998); Dabholkar (1999) (Dabholkar 1999); Gillespie (2004) (Gillespie 2004)\n\n\nSocial Science Research\nBabbie (2020) (Babbie 2020); Bryman (2016) (Bryman 2016); Bhattacherjee (2012) (Bhattacherjee 2012)\n\n\nStatistical Inference and Modeling\nCasella & Berger (2002) (Casella and Berger 2002); Hogg, McKean & Craig (2018) (Hogg, McKean, and Craig 2018); Agresti (2013) (Agresti 2013); Rao (2009) (Rao 2009); Rohatgi (1984) (Rohatgi 1984)\n\n\nData Visualization & Reporting\nTufte (2001) (Tufte 2001); Cleveland (1993) (Cleveland 1993); Few (2009) (Few 2009)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe algorithms and workflows integrated into RAISINS are grounded in established statistical theory, drawing extensively from authoritative texts and peer-reviewed literature. In cases where existing computational implementations were unavailable or insufficient, original algorithms were developed in adherence to rigorous theoretical principles. The platform’s design and interface have been iteratively refined based on user-centered feedback from researchers and educators, ensuring methodological soundness and usability consistent with global standards in scientific research and statistical education.\n\n\n2.2 Packages and Libraries\nRAISINS integrates a comprehensive ecosystem of open-source R and Python packages to deliver its core functionalities, encompassing statistical modeling, data visualization, artificial intelligence, and interactive web-based deployment. These packages support the platform’s goal of offering high-level statistical capabilities through an accessible and intuitive interface, particularly beneficial for students and researchers in agricultural sciences.\nThe R-based architecture of RAISINS is built around the shiny framework (Chang et al. 2024), which enables the development of dynamic, browser-accessible applications. Data manipulation tasks are performed using dplyr (Wickham et al. 2024), tidyr, and data.table, while data visualization is implemented through ggplot2 (Wickham 2023), along with complementary packages such as ggthemes, plotly (Sievert 2023), and ggpattern. For statistical analysis relevant to agricultural experiments and general inference, the platform employs packages including agricolae (Mendiburu 2020), broom (Robinson and Hayes 2024), effectsize, lsr, car, phia, and FactoMineR (Husson et al. 2020). These libraries provide robust support for model fitting, hypothesis testing, effect size estimation, and multivariate analysis.\nTo enhance user interaction and responsiveness, RAISINS integrates several user interface and usability packages, such as shinyWidgets, shinyalert, shinybusy, shinycustomloader, shinyBS, shinythemes, and colourpicker. The presentation and export of analytical results are managed through tools like rmarkdown, kableExtra, and formattable, ensuring professional and structured output for reports and publications.\nThe reticulate(Allaire et al. 2024) package serves as a bridge between R and Python, allowing both languages to be used seamlessly within the same analytical workflow. In RAISINS, reticulate enables the platform to call Python functions, use Python libraries, and exchange data objects between R and Python environments. This integration allows the platform to combine R’s interactive capabilities with Python’s strengths in machine learning, statistical modeling, and AI-driven tasks, thereby enhancing both flexibility and functionality.\nPython libraries are used to extend the platform’s analytical and AI-driven features. Packages such as pandas (The pandas development team 2024) and numpy (Harris et al. 2020) are employed for efficient data handling, while matplotlib and seaborn support graphical representations. For machine learning and statistical modeling, the platform uses scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al. 2011) and statsmodels (Seabold and Perktold 2010). The openai package enables the integration of language models, facilitating intelligent assistance and automated content generation within the platform.\nAll R and Python packages used in RAISINS are well-maintained, community-supported, and widely recognized within academic and applied data science contexts. Each library is carefully selected based on its performance, stability, and relevance to agricultural research workflows. Modules are thoroughly reviewed by subject-matter experts to ensure methodological accuracy and pedagogical effectiveness, thereby maintaining the platform’s commitment to reproducibility, transparency, and educational value."

    "section": "1 Introduction",
    "text": "1 Introduction\nPrice volatility is one of the significant sources of risk in agriculture especially in fruits and vegetable production. It is defined as the directionless fluctuations in prices that cannot be predicted with market fundamentals (Prakash 2011). Reasons for price volatility include supply-side shocks due to severe weather events or diseases, variations in demand, distortions in trade policies and supply chain disruptions (Gilbert and Morgan 2010; Ait Sidhoum and Serra 2016). The increasing unpredictability of changing economic and natural environment (Tothova 2011) and seasonal nature of the fruits and vegetables also amplifies price volatility. Moreover, poor shelf life of horticulture crops increases risk and leads to unstable markets (Cook 2011).\nVazhakulam in Ernakulam district has become the major hub for pineapple cultivation in Kerala (Joy 2013). Owing to its unique feature Vazhakulam pineapple has got Geographical indication tag also. Pineapple produced from the region has a long value chain and is marketed to various states like Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Delhi mainly through road ways. Limited quantity of fresh pineapple is being exported to Gulf countries in special packings (Pineapple Growers Association 2018).\nPineapple is a globally traded fruit crop from Kerala that had always been subject to price volatility. It is mainly because of the seasonal variations in demand for pineapple in markets. Climate change induced low production, seasonal disruptions in demand and supply are the main factors that affect price volatility. It was noted that the COVID induced lock down had severely affected the pineapple prices and farmer suicides were reported during the period. This pandemic had a significant negative impact on all sectors of human life, including the economy, food security and health (Saadat, Rawtani, and Hussain 2020). According to (Jribi et al. 2020), the pandemic had the potential to hinder the progress towards meeting several Sustainable Development Goals (United Nations SDG 2015-2030), in particular, SDG 2 (End Hunger) and SDG 12 (Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns). There were widespread disruptions in agriculture supply chain at the beginning of the lockdown (FAO 2021). It further lead to the scarcity of labour, disrupted supply chains and lack of demand and logistics restrictions in the agricultural sector (Cariappa et al. 2021).\nAlthough the price volatility of different agricultural commodities has been researched extensively in recent periods (Gilbert and Morgan 2010; Sabu, Kuruvila, and Manojkumar 2019; Yu et al. 2020), a lack of knowledge exists in the pineapple sector of Kerala. The knowledge about the price risk and volatility associated with the pineapple sector is important for pineapple farmers during the pandemic. This information is critical for developing suitable price risk management strategies, for coping up with similar situations. Hence the present study aims to analyse the price behaviour of Pineapple in Kerala."

    "text": "2 Materials and methods\n\n2.1 Study area\nThe study was conducted in Ernakulam district of Kerala. The study area was selected purposively as it has the largest area under pineapple cultivation in Kerala. Out of the total area under pineapple in Kerala, 58.73 per cent lies in Ernakulam district which produces about 63 per cent of the production of the state in the year (Government of Kerala 2020a). From the district, Muvattupuzha Block Panchayath was purposively selected based on the maximum area under pineapple cultivation. Three pineapple-growing grama panchayats viz., Avoly, Manjalloor, and Kalloorkkad were selected from the block panchayat randomly. Forty farmers each were randomly selected from these grama panchayaths making a total sample size of 120 farmers.\n\n\n2.2 Sampling and data collection\nThe study used time series data of daily prices of pineapple from January 2017 to September 2022 collected from Vazhakulam Pineapple Growers Association(PGA). Price collected can be aptly considered as representative price as most of the pineapple farmers are organized under PGA and trade pineapple through them. The prices represent the farm gate price received by the farmers and it is easily available in the website of Pineapple Growers Association(Pineapple Growers Association 2018). Data on daily prices of pineapple from January 2017 to March 2020 was taken as pre-COVID period and from April 2020 to September 2022 is taken as COVID-post-COVID period. January 2017 to September 2022 was taken as the overall period.\n\n\n2.3 GARCH models\nThe uncertainty surrounding prospective price fluctuation is referred to as volatility. There are different methods to estimate volatility such as historical moving average, Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA), Auto Regressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (ARCH) introduced by Engle (1982) and Generalized Auto-Regressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) introduced by Bollerslev (1986).\nSekhar (2004) compared the price volatility of different agricultural commodities in major Indian and international markets by using GARCH model. This model provided evidence on whether the estimated volatility is statistically significant or not. It also measures the persistence of volatility (Sabu 2015).\nThe ARCH process introduced by Engle (1982) explicitly recognizes the difference between the unconditional and the conditional variance allowing the latter to change over time as a function of past errors. The GARCH model of Bollerslev (1986) is an important type of time series model for heteroscedastic data. It explicitly models a time-varying conditional variance as a linear function of past squared residuals and of its past values. GARCH models are an extension of the ARCH models first introduced by Engle (1982) as it basically introduces a lagged conditional variance to the information set of an ARCH model. An ARCH model applied to price volatility basically assumes that a dependent variable of commodity prices, \\(P_i\\), is generated by the autoregressive process:\n\\[p_i = \\phi_0 + \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\phi_{1} P_{t-1} + \\varepsilon_t \\tag{1}\\]\nTo generate the ARCH\\((p)\\) process, we express the conditional variance of the above expression as a function of its past values squared:\n\\[\\varepsilon_t \\mid \\Omega_{t-1} \\sim N(0, h) \\tag{2}\\]\n\\[h_t^2 = \\delta + \\sum_{i=1}^{p} \\alpha_i \\varepsilon_{t-i}^2 \\tag{3}\\]\nWhere, \\(h_t^2\\) denotes the conditional variance of the information set \\(\\Omega_{t-1}\\) that is available at time \\(t-1\\), and \\(\\delta &gt; 0\\), \\(\\alpha_i \\geq 0\\) for all \\(i = 2 \\ldots p\\) and \\(\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2 + \\cdots + \\alpha_m &lt; 1\\), which are necessary to make \\(\\varepsilon_t^2\\) positive and covariance stationary.\nThe generalization of the ARCH process given in Equation 3 is as follows (Bollerslev 1986):\n\\[\nh_t^2 = \\delta + \\sum_{i=1}^{p} \\alpha_i \\varepsilon_{t-i}^2 + \\sum_{i=1}^{q} \\beta_i h_{t-i}^2\n\\tag{4}\\]\nThe GARCH model in Equation 4 depicts the conditional variance of a price series to depend on a constant, past news about volatility (i.e. the \\(\\varepsilon_{t-1}^2\\) terms). Including the lagged conditional variances might capture the “adaptive learning” phenomenon. The benefit of the GARCH specification is that it contains fewer coefficient restrictions. For a well-defined variance and covariance function: \\(\\delta, \\alpha &gt; 0; \\beta \\geq 0\\), and \\(\\alpha + \\beta &lt; 1\\).\nPersistence of volatility in the commodity series is measured by the sum of \\(\\alpha + \\beta\\). Downward price changes are often followed by higher volatility than upward movements of the same magnitude (Herrera and Espinel 2008).\nModels aim to define volatility clustering and effects such as kurtosis, forming the basis of dynamic volatility models.\nThe key is that volatility, rather than remaining constant or moving in a monotonic manner over time, is dependent on past realisations of the associated volatility i.e. the error variance is related to the squared error terms over several periods in the past (Singh 2020).\nThe ARCH-GARCH model was used to analyse the volatility and it was estimated using R software (R Core Team 2023). From the different models, Standard GARCH (1,1) (SGARCH) model was identified as the best model for this study based on the smallest Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) values (Lestari et al. 2022). This model distinguishes the predictable and unpredictable components of prices and also allows the variance of the unpredictable element to be time-varying. Such time varying conditional variances were estimated by using the SGARCH (1,1) model (Gujarati, Porter, and Gunasekhar 2009) and it was used to identify periods of high volatility.\nThe GARCH(1,1) model is specified as:\n\\[Y_{it} = \\alpha_0 + \\beta_1 P_{t-1} + \\beta_2 P_{t-2} + \\varepsilon_t \\quad ; \\quad t = 1, 2, \\ldots, t \\tag{5}\\]\n\\[\\sigma^2_{i,t} = \\theta + \\alpha_i \\varepsilon^2_{i,t-1} + \\beta_i \\sigma^2_{i,t-1} \\tag{6}\\]\nWhere \\(P_{t-1}\\) is the price at time \\(t-1\\) and \\(\\sigma^2_{i,t}\\) is the conditional error variance at time \\(t\\). The term \\((\\alpha_i + \\beta_i)\\) indicates the degree of persistence in price volatility. If the sum \\((\\alpha_i + \\beta_i)\\) is close to 1, it implies a high level of volatility persistence (Devi, Srikala, and Ananda 2015).\nThe general form of a GARCH(\\(p\\), \\(q\\)) model is:\n\\[\\sigma^2_{i,t} = \\omega + \\sum_{i=1}^{p} \\beta_i \\sigma^2_{t-i} + \\sum_{i=1}^{q} \\alpha_i \\varepsilon^2_{t-i} \\tag{7}\\]\nEquation Equation 5) captures the autoregressive part of the price model, while Equations Equation 6 and Equation 7 describe the time-varying variance component."

    "title": "Impact of COVID Lockdown on Price Volatility of Pineapple in Vazhakulam, Kerala",
    "section": "3 Results",
    "text": "3 Results\n\n3.1 Average monthly prices behaviour\nIn Vazhakulam, fresh pineapple is harvested at two stages: as green pineapple (harvested at 115 days after the ethephon application) and as ripe pineapple (harvested at 120–125 days after the ethephon application).\nThe present study analyzed the price volatility of both ripe and green pineapple using time series data of daily prices from January 2017 to September 2022. For analytical purposes, the data set was divided into the following three periods:\n\nPre-COVID period: January 2017 to March 2020\n\nCOVID–Post-COVID period: April 2020 to September 2022\n\nThe average monthly prices of both green and ripe pineapple during the pre-COVID and COVID–post-COVID periods are presented in Figure 1 (a) and Figure 1 (b), respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Pre-COVID period\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) COVID-Post-COVID period\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Average monthly prices (Rs./kg) of both green and ripe pineapple in Vazhakulam market during pre-covid and post-covid periods\n\n\n\nPrice of pineapple usually stood high during the summer months of April and May coinciding with summer and one-month long Ramdan fasting. So, many farmers targeted the harvest of the crop during these months. But in April 2020, during the first lockdown period due to strict restrictions, many pineapple plantations were abandoned without harvesting. This was mainly due to the unavailability of migrant labours (as they went back to their hometown fearing the disease). So, a steep decline in price was observed during that period. Prices started increasing as the restrictions were lifted gradually. Again in 2021, there was price drop in the months of May and June due to another lockdown and restrictions.\nThe price drop was to the level of Rs. 10/kg, which put farmers in distress. During the survey, many farmers reported that the price of pineapple had even dipped to Rs. 5/kg during the COVID period as they were not able to transport the produce to the Vazhakulam pineapple market. So, they sold produce in nearby markets. Many of the plantations were kept unharvested and harvested fruits fetched only very low price. Restrictions in interstate and intra state transport, fear of spread of virus through the fruits etc. worsened the situation. Many farmers terminated their lease contracts with landowners before expiry due to financial crisis and were unable to pay the lease amount and continue farming operations. Farmers reported that the reduction in the cultivated area had impacted total pineapple production from Vazhakulam. As the restrictions were gradually lifted towards the end of 2021, situation became normal and price hike was observed due to a reduced supply of pineapple to the market, with the demand for pineapple was same as earlier.\n\n\n3.2 Estimation of volatility using GARCH\nGARCH models are very popular in the analysis of price volatility. Standard GARCH(1,1) model was fitted to study the volatility in the prices of pineapple. The estimates of GARCH(1,1) model for ripe pineapple and green pineapple are presented in Table 1 and Table 2.\n\n\n\nTable 1: GARCH(1,1) estimates for ripe pineapple prices in Vazhakulam market.

It indicated that the volatility in the prices of pineapple was persistent despite the COVID-induced lockdown.\nIt is evident from Table 1 that the sum of coefficients \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) for the prices of ripe pineapple was higher in the COVID-post-COVID period, followed by the overall period. This indicated higher volatility in the prices of ripe pineapple during the COVID-post-COVID period. A similar trend was observed in the price of green pineapple (Table 2). This might be related to the reduced demand for pineapple in the market as a result of changes in the consumption behaviour of people during the pandemic. A study conducted by Yu et al. (2020) on the impact of COVID-19 on the prices of major food products in China found that rice and wheat showed no significant changes in prices after the COVID lockdown, whereas prices of cabbage showed higher volatility.\nAmong the green and ripe pineapple prices, higher volatility was observed in the prices of green pineapple as compared to ripe pineapple for all the periods—pre-COVID, COVID-post-COVID, and overall. The value of the \\(\\alpha + \\beta\\) term for green pineapple prices was close to one (0.916) during the post-COVID period, which indicated higher volatility in the prices of green pineapple after the lockdown. This could be because the effect of transportation restrictions during the lockdown on green pineapple was greater as it was marketed to North India, whereas mature ripe pineapple was marketed in Kerala and nearby states. In a similar attempt, while studying the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the prices of rice, chilli, and garlic in Indonesia, it was found that due to the government’s different social assistance programs, the impact of COVID-19 on the prices of rice was negligible, whereas the prices of chilli and garlic had decreased due to the pandemic. The study also found that the effect of COVID-19 on the prices of horticultural products was higher as compared to that on the prices of food grains (Zahraturrahmi et al. 2021).\n\n\n3.3 Volatility clustering\nTo provide more detailed insights in to the volatility in price of pineapple, the volatility clustering in daily prices of both green and ripe pineapple for pre-COVID, COVID-post-COVID and overall periods are shown in Figure 2 given below. These figures clearly underpin the estimated results of GARCH model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Pre-COVID period green pineapple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Pre-COVID period ripe pineapple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) COVID-post-COVID period green pineapple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) COVID-post-COVID period ripe pineapple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(e) Overall period green pineapple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(f) Overall period ripe pineapple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Volatility clustering in daily prices of green and ripe pineapple during pre-COVID, COVID-post-COVID, and overall periods.\n\n\n\nThe Figure 2 indicated that there was volatility in the prices of pineapple. But the volatility was more prominent during the COVID-post-COVID period. A lowest price of Rs.10 per kg was realized during the COVID period and it recovered gradually to Rs.60 per kg during the post-COVID period. According to Pineapple Growers Association Kerala, the farm gate price had come down to Rs.10 per kg compared to Rs.40 in the previous year due to lockdown (Kumar 2020). Thus, the pineapple farmers were in distress and they were unable to pay off their debts. There was also a report of farmer suicide due to financial losses in pineapple cultivation (Government of Kerala 2020b).\nIn a similar attempt, (Kaur 2021) in her study observed persistence of volatility in the prices of cereals, pulses and fruits before and after COVID-19. (Arumugam, Kanagavalli, and Manida 2020) revealed that the problem of labour shortage caused by a fear of viral transmission led to the wastage of harvested commodities, primarily fruits and vegetables, and also demand reduction of produce in the market. In a study conducted by (Pandya et al. 2021), the prices of all agricultural items dropped by about 70 percent due to a rapid drop in demand and an excess supply of farm products. According to (Hossain et al. 2020), COVID-19 not only affected physical health but also affected the mental health of farmers."

    "section": "Discussion",
    "text": "Discussion\nThe present study highlights the significant volatility in pineapple prices across pre-COVID, COVID-post-COVID, and overall periods in the Vazhakulam market. Results from the GARCH(1,1) model indicated that both green and ripe pineapple prices experienced persistent volatility, with a pronounced increase during the COVID-post-COVID period. This was evident from the higher \\(\\alpha + \\beta\\) values observed, especially for green pineapple, suggesting a strong memory in the price volatility process during this period.\nSeveral factors contributed to this heightened volatility. The COVID lockdowns imposed transport and logistics constraints and disrupted supply chains which caused a temporary collapse in market demand. This was reflected in steep price drops, with the price of pineapple falling as low as Rs 10 per kg during the lockdown, as reported by the Pineapple Growers Association (Kumar 2020). The inability to harvest or transport produce due to labour shortages further aggravated the situation (Arumugam, Kanagavalli, and Manida 2020).\nThe findings are consistent with similar studies on other horticultural commodities. (Kaur 2021) found continued volatility in food prices post-COVID, and (Pandya et al. 2021) noted an average price drop of 70% in farm produce during the early pandemic phase. Moreover, the psychological and financial stress induced by the pandemic led to cases of farmer distress and suicide, further underlining the socioeconomic impact (Hossain et al. 2020).\nIt was also evident that green pineapple prices were more volatile than ripe ones, potentially due to their greater dependence on inter-state transport, especially to North Indian markets. These insights underscore the vulnerability of perishable commodity sectors to external shocks and reinforce the need for effective price risk management, timely market intelligence, and supportive agricultural policy interventions."

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nPineapple cultivation remains a remunerative agricultural activity for many farmers in Kerala, particularly because it is one of the major fruit crops transported from the state to other parts of India. This study examined the price volatility in the Vazhakulam pineapple market during the pre-COVID, COVID-post-COVID, and overall periods. Findings revealed that pineapple farmers in Kerala have historically faced frequent price fluctuations, with significantly heightened volatility observed during the COVID-post-COVID period. This increase was primarily attributed to transportation restrictions and a fall in market demand due to the pandemic.\nThese results have important implications for policymakers. To stabilize the pineapple market, there is a need to develop more robust price risk management mechanisms. Although the Government of Kerala has fixed a base price of Rs 15 per kg for pineapple (Government of Kerala 2020b), the study found the average cost of production to be Rs 17.33 per kg. Therefore, it is recommended that the base price be revised to at least Rs 20–22 per kg to ensure profitability. The findings highlight the need for targeted policy support and risk management strategies to stabilize pineapple marketsin Kerala and protect farmer livelihoods during times of crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcknowledgments\n\n\n\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the support and encouragement provided by Kerala Agricultural University. They also sincerely thank the respondent farmers for their valuable time and cooperation during the course of the study."

    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe yardlong bean is one of the most important leguminous vegetables in Asia. Also known as the asparagus bean, string bean, snake bean, or snake pea, it was originally cultivated in West Africa and is now widely grown throughout Southeast Asia—including Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand—where it can be cultivated year-round. In India, it has been known since Vedic times (Benchasri, Bairaman, and Nualsri 2012).\nTypically harvested while still young, the yardlong bean is consumed as a green vegetable. It is an annual plant characterized by rapid growth, especially when supported by a trellis. Both tall and short climbing types exist. A member of the Fabaceae family, the plant features twining, delicate stems with a tenacious root system. It blooms in mid-summer, producing pairs of large white or purple flowers. Once pollinated, these flowers develop into slender, dark green beans that can grow up to 12 inches in just a few days. Mature beans can reach lengths of up to three feet, turning pale green and swelling as the red or black seeds ripen.\nThe yardlong bean also contributes to soil fertility by fixing atmospheric nitrogen through nodules on its roots. It is often referred to as the “poor man’s meat” because its pods are not only rich in protein (23–32% of seed weight) but also contain essential amino acids like lysine and tryptophan, as well as significant levels of folic acid, vitamin B, and other critical micronutrients (Peyrano, Speroni, and Avanza 2016). As such, it serves as a key dietary staple for many of the poorest populations in developing countries.\nDespite its nutritional and agricultural importance, relatively little breeding work has been conducted on this crop. The development of high-yielding, stress-tolerant varieties could significantly boost its cultivation and productivity. However, as a predominantly self-pollinated crop, studies on gene action in yardlong bean remain limited. This study aims to identify gene action governing yield-related traits, which will help inform new breeding strategies to enhance crop improvement efforts."

    "text": "2 Materials and methods\nThe genetic material used in the present study consisted of hybrid (\\(F_1\\)) plants derived from three promising crosses, along with their six respective parents. The selected parental inbred lines were chosen based solely on differences in yield-related traits. Three single-cross \\(F_1\\) hybrids were developed using parents with contrasting characteristics.\nThe three most promising hybrids, based on yield performance and disease resistance from a previous study, were selected for further evaluation. The \\(F_1\\) hybrids were backcrossed to their respective parents to generate backcross (BC) generations. Simultaneously, the \\(F_1\\) hybrids were self-pollinated to produce the corresponding \\(F_2\\) populations.\nGeneration mean analysis was conducted using eighteen populations in total: the three \\(F_1\\)s, their six parents, six backcross generations, and three \\(F_2\\) populations. The experiment was laid out in a randomized block design (RBD) with three replications in the College of Agriculture, Vellayani during Summer 2004. Standard crop management practices were followed throughout the study. Observations on yield and yield-related traits were recorded from 10 plants each for the \\(F_1\\), parent, and backcross generations. For the \\(F_2\\) populations, data were collected from 30 plants per cross.\n\n2.1 Generation Mean Analysis\nThe six-parameter model developed by Hayman (Hayman 1958) was used for generation mean analysis. The four scaling tests (\\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\)) were determined according to the method suggested by Mather (Mather 1949). These different scales are computed using simple linear combinations as given in Equation 1 to Equation 4.\n\\[A = 2\\overline{B_1} - \\overline{F_1} - P_1 = 0 \\tag{1}\\]\n\\[B = 2\\overline{B_2} - \\overline{F_1} - \\overline{P_2} = 0 \\tag{2}\\]\n\\[C = 4\\overline{F_2} - 2\\overline{F_1} - \\overline{P_1} - \\overline{P_2} = 0 \\tag{3}\\]\n\\[D = 4\\overline{F_3} - 2\\overline{F_2} - \\overline{P_1} - \\overline{P_2} = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad D = 2\\overline{F_2} - \\overline{B_2} - \\overline{B_1} \\tag{4}\\]\nWhere \\(P_1\\), \\(P_2\\), \\(F_1\\), \\(F_2\\), \\(B_1\\), and \\(B_2\\) are means of different generations, respectively. The variances of the quantities \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) were calculated from the respective variances of different generations as given from Equation 5 to Equation 8.\n\\[V_A = 4V_{\\overline{B_1}} + V_{\\overline{F_1}} + V_{\\overline{P_1}} \\tag{5}\\]\n\\[V_B = 4V_{\\overline{B_2}} + V_{\\overline{F_1}} + V_{\\overline{P_2}} \\tag{6}\\]\n\\[V_C = 16V_{\\overline{F_2}} + 4V_{\\overline{F_1}} + V_{\\overline{P_1}} + V_{\\overline{P_2}} \\tag{7}\\]\n\\[V_D = 16V_{\\overline{F_3}} + 4V_{\\overline{F_2}} + V_{\\overline{P_1}} + V_{\\overline{P_2}} \\tag{8}\\]\nWhere, \\(V_{P_1}\\) is the variance of the individuals within the \\(P_1\\) family; \\(V_{\\overline{P_1}}\\) is the variance of \\({\\overline{P_1}}\\) (mean of the \\(P_1\\) family); and \\(\\overline{V_{P_1}} = \\frac{V_{P_1}}{N}\\), where \\(N\\) is the number of individuals observed in the \\(P_1\\) family.\nThe standard error of \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) is calculated by taking the square root of their respective variances. The corresponding \\(t\\) values are computed by dividing the values of \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) by their respective standard errors.\nSignificance of any of the four scales indicates the inadequacy of the additive-dominance model and the presence of epistasis. If the calculated \\(t\\) values are found to be significant, the presence of specific types of epistasis is confirmed.\nThe significance of either one or both of the \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) scales indicates the presence of all three types of digenic interaction, namely additive × additive, additive × dominance, and dominance × dominance. The significance of scale \\(C\\) indicates the presence of dominance × dominance type of non-allelic interaction, while the significance of scale \\(D\\) denotes additive × additive type of gene action. When both \\(C\\) and \\(D\\) scales are significant, it suggests the presence of both additive × additive and dominance × dominance types of gene interaction.\n\n\n2.2 Estimation of gene effects\nSignificance of any of the scales \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\) and \\(D\\) will indicate the presence of epistatic interaction or digenic interactions. Hayman and Jinks and Jones gave a 6 parameter model for the estimation of various genetic components. The six genetic parameters were estimated using Equation 9 to Equation 14.\n\\[m = \\overline{F_2} \\tag{9}\\]\n\\[d = \\overline{B_1} - \\overline{B_2} \\tag{10}\\]\n\\[h = \\overline{F_1} - 4\\overline{F_2} - \\frac{\\overline{P_1}}{2}- \\frac{\\overline{P_2}}{2} + 2\\overline{B_1} + 2\\overline{B_2} \\tag{11}\\]\n\\[i = 2\\overline{B_1} + 2\\overline{B_2} - 4\\overline{F_2} \\tag{12}\\]\n\\[j = \\overline{B_1} - \\frac{\\overline{P_1}}{2} - \\overline{B_2} + \\frac{\\overline{P_2}}{2} \\tag{13}\\]\n\\[l = \\overline{P_1} + \\overline{P_2} + 2\\overline{F_1} + 4\\overline{F_2} - 4\\overline{B_1} - 4\\overline{B_2} \\tag{14}\\]\nWhere \\(m\\) = mean; \\(d\\) = additive effect; \\(h\\) = dominance effect; \\(i\\) = additive x additive gene interaction; \\(j\\) = additive x dominance gene interaction; \\(l\\) = dominance x dominance gene interaction.\nThe variances of the six genetic parameters were calculated using Equation 15 to Equation 20\n\\[(m) = V_{\\overline{F_2}} \\tag{15}\\]\n\\[V(d) = V_{\\overline{B_1}} + V_{\\overline{B_2}} \\tag{16}\\]\n\\[V(h) = V_{\\overline{F_1}} + 16V_{\\overline{F_2}} + \\frac{V_{\\overline{P_1}}}{4} + \\frac{V_{\\overline{P_2}}}{4} + 4V_{\\overline{B_1}} + 4V_{\\overline{B_2}} \\tag{17}\\]\n\\[V(i) = 4V_{\\overline{B_1}} + 4V_{\\overline{B_2}} + 16V_{\\overline{F_2}} \\tag{18}\\]\n\\[V(j) = V_{\\overline{B_1}} + \\frac{V_{\\overline{P_1}}}{4} + V_{\\overline{B_2}} + \\frac{V_{\\overline{P_2}}}{4} \\tag{19}\\]\n\\[V(l) = 4V_{\\overline{P_1}} + 4V_{\\overline{P_2}} + 4V_{\\overline{F_1}} + 16V_{\\overline{F_2}} + 16V_{\\overline{B_1}} + 16V_{\\overline{B_2}} \\tag{20}\\]"

    "text": "3 Results\nGeneration mean analysis is a statistical technique used to estimate the components of variance and determine the predominant type of gene action controlling important traits in a crop species. This analysis assists in selecting appropriate breeding strategies for the improvement of various quantitative traits.\nGeneration mean analysis was conducted for three cowpea crosses:\n\nCross 1: VS86 × VS132\n\nCross 2: Kozhicode Local-2 × Thiruvananthapuram Local-12\n\nCross 3: Thiruvananthapuram Local-9 × Thiruvananthapuram Local-12\n\nThe mean values of the six generations (\\(P_1\\), \\(P_2\\), \\(F_1\\), \\(F_2\\), \\(B_1\\), and \\(B_2\\)) for each cross are presented in Table 1. Among them, the \\(F_1\\) of Cross 3 flowered the earliest (38.4 days), while Cross 1 was harvested the earliest (58.1 days). The \\(F_1\\) of Cross 2 exhibited the highest pod yield per plant (454.91 g), whereas the \\(B_2\\) generation of Cross 1 recorded the maximum yield overall (485.67 g).\nThe scale values and genetic component estimates for the various traits across the three crosses are shown in Table 2 and Table 3. The estimated mean effect (\\(m\\)) was highly significant for traits such as days to flowering, pod length, pod breadth, pods per plant, pod yield per plant, and root weight across all crosses, indicating that these traits are quantitatively inherited.\nAs shown in Table 3, significant negative dominant effects (\\(h\\)) were observed for pod length and pod yield per plant, suggesting that these traits are more prominently expressed in homozygous individuals.\n\n\n\nTable 1: Generation mean values of the three crosses in yardlong

    "text": "Discussion\nThe significance of scales \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) for most traits indicates that the simple additive-dominance model is inadequate for explaining their inheritance, as reported by Thakare et al. (2016) and Kudiabor et al. (2023). Non-allelic interactions, alongside additive and dominance components, were observed in the expression of several traits, similar to the findings of Edematie et al. (2021) and Akombo et al. (2021).\nSignificant additive × additive (\\(i\\)) interactions were found for pod length, pods per plant, pod yield per plant, and root weight, suggesting complementary or duplicate epistasis. Non-allelic interactions were also evident in traits like days to first flowering. Here, additive effects were highly significant, and additive × dominance (\\(j\\)) interactions were also observed. Dominance × dominance (\\(l\\)) interactions acted in a favorable negative direction in all hybrids. Similar epistatic interactions for early flowering and duplicate epistasis for traits like days to 90% pod maturity in cowpea were reported by Patel et al. (2013), Thakare et al. (2016), and Owusu et al. (2022).\nThese findings imply that earliness in cowpea could be improved through hybridization followed by the selection of promising recombinants in later generations, particularly in crosses governed by duplicate epistasis.\nThe significance of scales \\(C\\) and \\(D\\) for pod length further supports the involvement of dominance × dominance and additive × additive interactions in this trait. Significant additive (\\(d\\)) and dominance (\\(h\\)) effects for pod length were also reported by Rashwan (2010) and Thakare et al. (2013).\nAmong epistatic interactions, dominance × dominance (\\(l\\)), additive × additive (\\(i\\)), and additive × dominance (\\(j\\)) were observed in different crosses. In the case of pod weight, both dominance effects and additive × additive interactions were significant but acted in a negative direction. However, the positive significance of dominance × dominance interactions suggests that hybridization followed by selection would be an effective strategy for improving this trait.\nAll three types of digenic interactions (\\(i\\), \\(j\\), \\(l\\)) were observed for pods per plant. While additive × dominance (\\(j\\)) was positive and significant, both dominance (\\(h\\)) and additive × additive (\\(i\\)) effects acted in the negative direction. The presence of non-allelic interactions for this trait aligns with the findings of Thakare et al. (2016) and Edematie et al. (2021). Significant positive dominance (\\(h\\)) and dominance × dominance (\\(l\\)) interactions suggest the presence of complementary epistasis. In contrast, the negative significance of dominance × dominance (\\(l\\)) for pod yield per plant implies limited potential for improvement through heterosis breeding for this trait.\nThe direction of dominance and dominance × dominance interactions indicated duplicate gene action in the expression of traits such as pod weight, pod breadth, pods per cluster, seeds per pod, root weight per plant, and days to first harvest. Dominance was found to play a role in all traits, especially pod length, as reported by Santos et al. (2024) and Pallavi, Singh, and Chaudhary (2019).\nBoth additive × additive and dominance × dominance interactions were significant for root weight per plant, while the insignificance of all four scale tests (\\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), \\(D\\)) for traits like pod breadth, pods per cluster, seeds per pod, days to first harvest, primary branches per plant, and 100-seed weight indicates the adequacy of the additive-dominance model for these traits, and the absence of epistasis. Nonetheless, duplicate epistasis for most yield-related traits in cowpea was previously reported by Shinde et al. (2021)."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThe generation mean analysis conducted on three cowpea crosses revealed complex genetic control for several important agronomic traits. While the mean effect was highly significant for all key traits, indicating their quantitative nature, the inadequacy of the simple additive-dominance model—evidenced by significant scale tests and the presence of epistasis—highlights the role of non-allelic gene interactions in trait inheritance. Additive × additive, additive × dominance, and dominance × dominance interactions were frequently observed across traits such as pod length, pod yield per plant, pods per plant, and root weight. The predominance of duplicate and complementary epistasis suggests that hybridization followed by selection in segregating generations would be an effective breeding strategy for improving these traits.\nTraits like pod breadth, seeds per pod, and 100-seed weight showed no significant epistasis, indicating that selection based on the additive-dominance model may suffice for their improvement. Conversely, traits influenced by significant non-additive gene actions, such as pod yield and pod weight, may benefit more from recombination breeding approaches. Overall, this study underscores the importance of understanding the underlying gene action for designing appropriate breeding strategies. The insights gained provide a valuable foundation for improving yield and related traits in cowpea through targeted hybridization and selection efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcknowledgments\n\n\n\nThe first author gratefully acknowledges the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Government of India, for awarding the Junior Research Fellowship (JRF) in support of the Ph.D. programme."
