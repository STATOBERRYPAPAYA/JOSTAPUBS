    "section": "1 Introduction",
    "text": "1 Introduction\nStatistical analysis serves as the backbone of scientific research, especially in disciplines like agriculture, where field experiments, survey data, and observational studies generate complex datasets. Despite the increasing emphasis on data-driven decision-making in agricultural research, many students, early-career researchers, and practitioners find themselves at a disadvantage when it comes to performing rigorous statistical analyses. The process is often hindered by a combination of factors: the steep learning curve associated with programming languages such as R and Python, the fragmented nature of statistical learning resources, and the lack of user-friendly tools tailored to agricultural research contexts.\nWhile R and Python are powerful, flexible, and widely adopted in academic and professional settings, their command-line interfaces and syntax-heavy operations can be challenging for those without formal training in statistics or computer programming. Beginners frequently struggle with package selection, data cleaning, model specification, and interpretation of results. Furthermore, existing statistical software either lacks the flexibility and transparency of open-source tools or comes with licensing restrictions and high costs that limit accessibility in resource-constrained settings, particularly in developing countries.\nIn addition, agricultural research involves domain-specific needs such as handling experimental designs (e.g., CRD, RBD, split-plot), analyzing agronomic trials, processing survey data with appropriate sampling designs, and interpreting interactions between multiple environmental and genetic factors. Traditional statistical packages are not always well-adapted to these specific requirements, leaving researchers to either customize solutions on their own or consult specialists — both of which can delay or compromise the analytical workflow.\nTo bridge this gap, we developed RAISINS (R and AI Solutions for INferential Statistics) — a web-based platform designed to simplify and democratize statistical analysis for agricultural research. RAISINS integrates the power of R, Python, and AI-driven assistance within an intuitive interface that eliminates the need for code-based interaction. By abstracting complex syntax and offering guided, step-by-step workflows for data upload, analysis, visualization, and interpretation, the platform empowers users to focus on scientific inquiry rather than technical execution.\nBuilt on open-source technologies and scalable cloud infrastructure, RAISINS provides modules for commonly used statistical methods — including descriptive analysis, hypothesis testing, regression models, design of experiments, multi environmental trials, and more — while incorporating AI tools that assist in data summarization, analytical suggestions, and natural language explanations of results. This makes it an ideal solution for students, researchers, extension personnel, and educators engaged in agricultural and allied sciences. RAISINS can be accessed online through its official web portal at https://www.raisins.live/.\nIn this paper, we present the design, features, and use-cases of RAISINS, and demonstrate how it addresses the unique challenges faced in agricultural data analysis by offering an accessible, robust, and intelligent statistical platform."

    "text": "2 Materials and methods\n\n2.1 Platform architecture and module validation\nRAISINS is a modular cloud-hosted, web-based platform that integrates statistical computing, artificial intelligence, and modern pedagogical design to serve agricultural researchers and students. Built using R, Python, and OpenAI APIs, RAISINS is deployed via Posit Connect Cloud (https://connect.posit.cloud/), enabling browser-based access without requiring any local software installation. The RAISINS platform is modular and each statistical tool within is aligned with the theoretical underpinnings found in globally recognized academic literature.\nAll modules in RAISINS have been peer-reviewed by domain experts, including statisticians specializing in design of experiments, genetics, and social science research. This ensures both methodological rigor and instructional clarity.\nTable 1 presents the major analytical domains addressed by RAISINS, the foundational academic references supporting each module domain, organized by area of application.\n\n\n\nTable 1: Foundational literature supporting each RAISINS module domain, organized by area of application.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModule Domain\nTheoretical Foundation\n\n\n\n\nDesign & Analysis of Experiments\nMontgomery (2017) (Montgomery 2017); Gomez & Gomez (1984) (Gomez and Gomez 1984); Das & Giri (2018) (Das and Giri 2018); Searle (1997) (Searle 1997); Dey (1986) (Dey 1986); Cox & Reid (2000) (Cox and Reid 2000); Toutenburg & Shalabh (2009) (Toutenburg and Shalabh 2009); Cochran & Cox (1957) (Cochran and Cox 1957); ; Federer (1985) (Federer 1985)\n\n\nStatistical Genetics\nFalconer & Mackay (1996) (Falconer and Mackay 1996); Lynch & Walsh (1998) (Lynch and Walsh 1998); Dabholkar (1999) (Dabholkar 1999); Gillespie (2004) (Gillespie 2004)\n\n\nSocial Science Research\nBabbie (2020) (Babbie 2020); Bryman (2016) (Bryman 2016); Bhattacherjee (2012) (Bhattacherjee 2012)\n\n\nStatistical Inference and Modeling\nCasella & Berger (2002) (Casella and Berger 2002); Hogg, McKean & Craig (2018) (Hogg, McKean, and Craig 2018); Agresti (2013) (Agresti 2013); Rao (2009) (Rao 2009); Rohatgi (1984) (Rohatgi 1984)\n\n\nData Visualization & Reporting\nTufte (2001) (Tufte 2001); Cleveland (1993) (Cleveland 1993); Few (2009) (Few 2009)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe algorithms and workflows integrated into RAISINS are grounded in established statistical theory, drawing extensively from authoritative texts and peer-reviewed literature. In cases where existing computational implementations were unavailable or insufficient, original algorithms were developed in adherence to rigorous theoretical principles. The platform’s design and interface have been iteratively refined based on user-centered feedback from researchers and educators, ensuring methodological soundness and usability consistent with global standards in scientific research and statistical education.\n\n\n2.2 Packages and Libraries\nRAISINS integrates a comprehensive ecosystem of open-source R and Python packages to deliver its core functionalities, encompassing statistical modeling, data visualization, artificial intelligence, and interactive web-based deployment. These packages support the platform’s goal of offering high-level statistical capabilities through an accessible and intuitive interface, particularly beneficial for students and researchers in agricultural sciences.\nThe R-based architecture of RAISINS is built around the shiny framework (Chang et al. 2024), which enables the development of dynamic, browser-accessible applications. Data manipulation tasks are performed using dplyr (Wickham et al. 2024), tidyr, and data.table, while data visualization is implemented through ggplot2 (Wickham 2023), along with complementary packages such as ggthemes, plotly (Sievert 2023), and ggpattern. For statistical analysis relevant to agricultural experiments and general inference, the platform employs packages including agricolae (Mendiburu 2020), broom (Robinson and Hayes 2024), effectsize, lsr, car, phia, and FactoMineR (Husson et al. 2020). These libraries provide robust support for model fitting, hypothesis testing, effect size estimation, and multivariate analysis.\nTo enhance user interaction and responsiveness, RAISINS integrates several user interface and usability packages, such as shinyWidgets, shinyalert, shinybusy, shinycustomloader, shinyBS, shinythemes, and colourpicker. The presentation and export of analytical results are managed through tools like rmarkdown, kableExtra, and formattable, ensuring professional and structured output for reports and publications.\nThe reticulate(Allaire et al. 2024) package serves as a bridge between R and Python, allowing both languages to be used seamlessly within the same analytical workflow. In RAISINS, reticulate enables the platform to call Python functions, use Python libraries, and exchange data objects between R and Python environments. This integration allows the platform to combine R’s interactive capabilities with Python’s strengths in machine learning, statistical modeling, and AI-driven tasks, thereby enhancing both flexibility and functionality.\nPython libraries are used to extend the platform’s analytical and AI-driven features. Packages such as pandas (The pandas development team 2024) and numpy (Harris et al. 2020) are employed for efficient data handling, while matplotlib and seaborn support graphical representations. For machine learning and statistical modeling, the platform uses scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al. 2011) and statsmodels (Seabold and Perktold 2010). The openai package enables the integration of language models, facilitating intelligent assistance and automated content generation within the platform.\nAll R and Python packages used in RAISINS are well-maintained, community-supported, and widely recognized within academic and applied data science contexts. Each library is carefully selected based on its performance, stability, and relevance to agricultural research workflows. Modules are thoroughly reviewed by subject-matter experts to ensure methodological accuracy and pedagogical effectiveness, thereby maintaining the platform’s commitment to reproducibility, transparency, and educational value."

    "section": "1 Introduction",
    "text": "1 Introduction\nSesame (Sesamum indicum L., 2n=2x=26) represents one of humanity’s most ancient cultivated oilseed crops, with archaeological evidence suggesting its cultivation dates back over 4,000 years (Bedigian 2015). Known by various vernacular names including Gingelly, Ellu in Malayalam, and Tila in Sanskrit, this crop holds profound cultural and religious significance, particularly in Indian traditions where sesame seeds feature prominently in Hindu religious ceremonies (Wei et al. 2015). The ancient Sanskrit etymology supports the hypothesis that sesame may have been the source of the first extracted vegetable oil, underlining its historical importance in human nutrition (Pathak et al. 2014). Modern nutritional analysis reveals that sesame seeds contain 50–60% oil of exceptional quality, comparable to olive oil in its nutritional profile (Uzun, Yol, and Furat 2008; Anilakumar et al. 2010).\nSesame oil demonstrates remarkable stability compared to other edible oils, primarily attributed to its rich content of natural antioxidants including sesamin, sesaminol, sesamol, sesamolinol, and squalene (Namiki 2007; Kamal-Eldin, Moazzami, and Washi 2011). The oil’s high concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids, combined with its cholesterol-lowering and blood pressure-reducing properties, has renewed scientific and commercial interest in this ancient crop (Sankar et al. 2006; Gouveia et al. 2014; Dalibalta, Majdalawieh, and Manjikian 2020).\nRecent genomic studies have revealed the complex genetic architecture underlying sesame’s agronomic traits, with high-throughput sequencing technologies enabling the identification of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with yield components and stress tolerance (Zhang et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2016; Yu et al. 2019). These advances have opened new avenues for marker-assisted selection and genomic breeding approaches (Wei et al. 2016; Dossa et al. 2017).\nDespite its nutritional superiority and agricultural advantages—including drought tolerance, low input requirements, and suitability for crop rotations due to its extensive taproot system (Ashri 2007)—sesame productivity remains disappointingly low. India, while leading globally in both cultivation area (1.8 million hectares) and production (0.87 million tonnes), achieves an average productivity of only 483 kg/ha, significantly below China (1,200 kg/ha) and Turkey (1,100 kg/ha) (FAO 2020; Yahaya et al. 2021)."

Days to flowering ranged from 18.73 days (KYM-1) to 34.8 days (Tilarani) with a mean of 27.35 days. Plant height showed extensive variation from 31.40 cm (IVTS-06-12) to 107.97 cm (Soma), averaging 53.44 cm. Seed yield per plant, the most variable trait, ranged from 1.35g (IVTS-06-22) to 7.02g (SVPR-1) with a mean of 3.47g.\nThe genetic parameters for the traits studied as a part of the experiment are presented in Table 3.\nNumber of branches per plant (51.83%) and capsules per plant (43.56%) show the highest variability, indicating excellent prospects for selection and breeding. Low variability in 1000-seed weight (2.95%) suggests this trait is more genetically stable across genotypes.\nAll traits exhibited high broad-sense heritability exceeding 85%. The highest heritability was observed for locules per capsule (100%) followed by plant height (99.75%), seed yield per plant (98.69%), and number of capsules per plant (98.34%).\nThe significant genetic variation observed across all studied traits provides a robust foundation for sesame breeding programs. High heritability estimates (&gt;85%) for all traits indicate that observed phenotypic variation primarily reflects genetic differences rather than environmental effects, facilitating effective selection strategies (Allard 1960; H. Kumar and Garg 2016). The combination of high heritability with high genetic advance for days to flowering, plant height, number of branches per plant, number of capsules per plant, and seed yield per plant suggests predominant additive gene action, making these traits responsive to simple selection methods (Burton 1952; A. Singh and Chaudhary 2006). Genotypic correlation coefficients generally exceeded phenotypic correlations, indicating strong genetic associations among traits. Seed yield per plant showed significant positive correlations with days to flowering (\\(r = 0.321^{*}\\)), plant height (\\(r = 0.633^{**}\\)), number of branches per plant (\\(r = 0.552^{**}\\)), number of capsules per plant (\\(r = 0.956^{**}\\)), locules per capsule (\\(r = 0.312^{*}\\)), and oil content (\\(r = 0.438^{**}\\)).\n\n\n\nTable 4: Genotypic correlation coefficients among traits in sesame genotypes\n\n\n\n\n\nTrait\n\\(X_1\\)\n\\(X_2\\)\n\\(X_3\\)\n\\(X_4\\)\n\\(X_5\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(X_1\\)\n1.000\n0.956**\n0.633**\n0.552**\n0.438**\n\n\n\\(X_2\\)\n0.956**\n1.000\n0.625**\n0.683**\n0.423**\n\n\n\\(X_3\\)\n0.633**\n0.625**\n1.000\n0.582**\n0.491**\n\n\n\\(X_4\\)\n0.552**\n0.683**\n0.582**\n1.000\n0.367*\n\n\n\\(X_5\\)\n0.438**\n0.423**\n0.491**\n0.367*\n1.000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Table 4, the traits denoted by \\(X_1\\) to \\(X_5\\) are:\n\\(X_1\\) – Seed yield per plant (g)\n\\(X_2\\) – Number of capsules per plant\n\\(X_3\\) – Plant height (cm)\n\\(X_4\\) – Number of branches per plant\n\\(X_5\\) – Oil content (%) Correlation significance: p &lt; 0.05 (), p* &lt; 0.01 (**)\n\nNumber of capsules per plant shows the strongest positive correlation with seed yield (\\(r = 0.956^{**}\\)), making it the most reliable indirect selection criterion. Plant height and branches per plant also show strong positive associations, indicating coordinated plant architecture development. The strong positive correlation between number of capsules per plant and seed yield (\\(r = 0.956^{**}\\)) confirms this trait as the most reliable selection criterion for yield improvement.\n\n\n\nTable 5: Direct and indirect effects of different traits on seed yield in sesame\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrait\nDirect Effect\n\\(X_1\\)\n\\(X_2\\)\n\\(X_3\\)\n\\(X_4\\)\n\\(X_5\\)\n\\(X_6\\)\n\\(X_7\\)\nTotal Correlation\n\n\n\n\n\\(X_1\\)\n-0.108\n–\n-0.016\n-0.070\n0.453\n-0.032\n0.001\n-0.004\n0.321\n\n\n\\(X_2\\)\n0.077\n-0.023\n–\n-0.136\n0.698\n0.027\n-0.011\n0.001\n0.633\n\n\n\\(X_3\\)\n-0.231\n-0.032\n0.046\n–\n0.769\n0.008\n-0.008\n0.000\n0.552\n\n\n\\(X_4\\)\n1.106\n-0.044\n0.049\n-0.160\n–\n0.016\n-0.009\n-0.002\n0.956\n\n\n\\(X_5\\)\n0.106\n-0.033\n0.019\n-0.016\n0.169\n–\n-0.004\n-0.002\n0.240\n\n\n\\(X_6\\)\n0.022\n-0.069\n-0.004\n0.019\n0.109\n-0.011\n–\n0.004\n0.109\n\n\n\\(X_7\\)\n-0.020\n-0.004\n0.041\n-0.093\n0.512\n0.021\n0.054\n–\n0.469\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Table 5, the traits denoted by \\(X_1\\) to \\(X_7\\) are: \\(X_1\\) – Days to flowering\n\\(X_2\\) – Plant height (cm)\n\\(X_3\\) – Number of branches per plant\n\\(X_4\\) – Number of capsules per plant\n\\(X_5\\) – Capsule length (cm)\n\\(X_6\\) – 1000-seed weight (g)\n\\(X_7\\) – Oil content (%)\n\nPath analysis as depicted in Table 5 revealed that number of capsules per plant exerted the highest positive direct effect (1.106) on seed yield per plant, followed by capsule length (0.106), plant height (0.077), and 1000-seed weight (0.022). Conversely, number of branches per plant showed the highest negative direct effect (-0.231), followed by days to flowering (-0.108) and oil content (-0.020). The residual effect was 0.203, indicating that approximately 80% of variation in seed yield was explained by the studied traits. The negative direct effect of branches per plant (\\(-0.231\\)) despite positive correlation suggests indirect benefits through increased capsule production. Plant height contributes mainly through indirect effects via capsule production. The analysis explains 79.66% of yield variation, indicating good model adequacy.\n\n3.1 Genetic divergence analysis\nMahalanobis \\(D^2\\) analysis revealed that plant height contributed maximum to total divergence (69.74%), followed by days to flowering (7.56%) and seed yield per plant (6.67%). This indicates plant height as the primary discriminating factor among genotypes.\nPlant height is the major contributor to genetic divergence among sesame genotypes, followed by flowering time and seed yield components as depicted in Figure 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Contribution of traits to total genetic divergence\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Cluster analysis\nThe 40 genotypes were grouped into six distinct clusters. Cluster I was the largest with 30 genotypes, while Clusters III, IV, V, and VI each contained single genotypes.

(2015); S. Singh et al. (2020)). This finding has important implications for breeding programs, suggesting that local germplasm may harbor unexploited genetic diversity.\nCluster V (SVPR-1) shows highest yield potential, Cluster IV (Soma) exhibits superior plant architecture, and Cluster VI (KYM-1) offers early maturity with high oil content. Strategic crosses between distant clusters (III × IV) could maximize genetic variation in breeding populations.\nRecent molecular diversity studies using SNP markers have corroborated these findings. Wang et al. (2016) analyzed 705 sesame accessions using genome-wide SNPs and found similar clustering patterns, with genetic diversity being more strongly associated with breeding history than geographical origin. The maximum divergence between Clusters III and IV (\\(D^2 = 75.04\\)) in our study corresponds to regions of low genetic similarity identified in genomic studies (Dossa et al. 2017).\nBased on comprehensive evaluation, several genotypes emerged as superior performers across multiple traits as depicted Figure 2. SVPR-1 demonstrated the highest seed yield (7.02 g/plant), while KYM-1 showed the earliest flowering and highest oil content. Soma exhibited exceptional plant architecture with maximum height and branching.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Performance of elite genotypes for seed yield,oil content and capsules per plant"

    "text": "Discussion\nThe combination of high heritability with high genetic advance for days to flowering, plant height, number of branches per plant, number of capsules per plant, and seed yield per plant suggests predominant additive gene action, making these traits responsive to simple selection methods (Burton 1952; A. Singh and Chaudhary 2006). These findings align with recent reports by Gangwar et al. (2021), Ahmad et al. (2020), and Yahaya et al. (2021), who observed similar patterns in diverse sesame germplasm collections.\nThe strong positive correlation between number of capsules per plant and seed yield (\\(r = 0.9558^{**}\\)) confirms this trait as the most reliable selection criterion for yield improvement. Path analysis further substantiated this relationship by revealing the highest direct effect (1.1063) of capsule number on seed yield. Similar findings have been reported in recent studies by R. Kumar et al. (2019), Gangwar et al. (2021), and Ahmad et al. (2020). The characters plant height, branches per plant, capsules per plant, and oil content showed significant and positive association with seed yield per plant. Therefore, simultaneous improvement of seed yield may be possible through selection of these characters. These matched the reports and conclusions of V. Kumar et al. (2022) and Patel et al. (2023).\nModern breeding programs increasingly utilize these correlation patterns in genomic prediction models. Zhang et al. (2013) demonstrated that incorporating trait correlations into genomic selection algorithms improved prediction accuracy for seed yield by 25% compared to single-trait models. The strong genetic correlations observed in our study suggest that multi-trait selection indices could be particularly effective in sesame breeding (Yu et al. 2019).\nMurthy and Kulkarni (1996) explained that wide adaptability of divergent types could be possible due to factors such as heterogeneity, genetic architecture of the populations, past history of selection, developmental factors, and degree of general combining ability. In the present study, varieties developed at the same location were found to be grouped in different clusters, indicating more divergence. For example, sesame varieties from Kerala Agricultural University were found to be grouped in Clusters II, IV, and VI. This confirms the earlier findings of Raut et al. (1991) that genetic drift and human selection could cause greater diversity than geographical spacing.\nAngadi (1976) reported that varieties in a cluster with a high order of divergence among themselves would be the best breeding materials for achieving maximum genetic advance with regard to yield. Selection within a cluster might also be exercised based on the highest mean performance of the varieties for desirable traits such as seed yield."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThis comprehensive genetic analysis of 40 sesame genotypes revealed substantial genetic variability suitable for breeding programs. High heritability estimates coupled with significant genetic advance indicate favorable prospects for genetic improvement through selection. Number of capsules per plant emerged as the most critical trait for yield improvement, while genetic divergence analysis identified optimal parent combinations for hybridization programs.\nThe identification of genetically divergent clusters provides a scientific basis for systematic breeding approaches. Integration of conventional breeding with molecular markers and genomic selection offers promising avenues for accelerating genetic gains. Future breeding efforts should prioritize crosses between genotypes from distant clusters while maintaining focus on high-performing individuals within clusters.\nThe superior genotypes identified in this study (SVPR-1, Soma, KYM-1, and Tilatara) represent valuable genetic resources for developing climate-resilient varieties with enhanced yield potential and oil quality.

    "section": "1 Introduction",
    "text": "1 Introduction\nPrice volatility is one of the significant sources of risk in agriculture especially in fruits and vegetable production. It is defined as the directionless fluctuations in prices that cannot be predicted with market fundamentals (Prakash 2011). Reasons for price volatility include supply-side shocks due to severe weather events or diseases, variations in demand, distortions in trade policies and supply chain disruptions (Gilbert and Morgan 2010; Ait Sidhoum and Serra 2016). The increasing unpredictability of changing economic and natural environment (Tothova 2011) and seasonal nature of the fruits and vegetables also amplifies price volatility. Moreover, poor shelf life of horticulture crops increases risk and leads to unstable markets (Cook 2011).\nVazhakulam in Ernakulam district has become the major hub for pineapple cultivation in Kerala (Joy 2013). Owing to its unique feature Vazhakulam pineapple has got Geographical indication tag also. Pineapple produced from the region has a long value chain and is marketed to various states like Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Delhi mainly through road ways. Limited quantity of fresh pineapple is being exported to Gulf countries in special packings (Pineapple Growers Association 2018).\nPineapple is a globally traded fruit crop from Kerala that had always been subject to price volatility. It is mainly because of the seasonal variations in demand for pineapple in markets. Climate change induced low production, seasonal disruptions in demand and supply are the main factors that affect price volatility. It was noted that the COVID induced lock down had severely affected the pineapple prices and farmer suicides were reported during the period. This pandemic had a significant negative impact on all sectors of human life, including the economy, food security and health (Saadat, Rawtani, and Hussain 2020). According to (Jribi et al. 2020), the pandemic had the potential to hinder the progress towards meeting several Sustainable Development Goals (United Nations SDG 2015-2030), in particular, SDG 2 (End Hunger) and SDG 12 (Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns). There were widespread disruptions in agriculture supply chain at the beginning of the lockdown (FAO 2021). It further lead to the scarcity of labour, disrupted supply chains and lack of demand and logistics restrictions in the agricultural sector (Cariappa et al. 2021).\nAlthough the price volatility of different agricultural commodities has been researched extensively in recent periods (Gilbert and Morgan 2010; Sabu, Kuruvila, and Manojkumar 2019; Yu et al. 2020), a lack of knowledge exists in the pineapple sector of Kerala. The knowledge about the price risk and volatility associated with the pineapple sector is important for pineapple farmers during the pandemic. This information is critical for developing suitable price risk management strategies, for coping up with similar situations. Hence the present study aims to analyse the price behaviour of Pineapple in Kerala."

    "section": "2 Materials and methods",
    "text": "2 Materials and methods\n\n2.1 Study area\nThe study was conducted in Ernakulam district of Kerala. The study area was selected purposively as it has the largest area under pineapple cultivation in Kerala. Out of the total area under pineapple in Kerala, 58.73 per cent lies in Ernakulam district which produces about 63 per cent of the production of the state in the year (Government of Kerala 2020a). From the district, Muvattupuzha Block Panchayath was purposively selected based on the maximum area under pineapple cultivation. Three pineapple-growing grama panchayats viz., Avoly, Manjalloor, and Kalloorkkad were selected from the block panchayat randomly. Forty farmers each were randomly selected from these grama panchayaths making a total sample size of 120 farmers.\n\n\n2.2 Sampling and data collection\nThe study used time series data of daily prices of pineapple from January 2017 to September 2022 collected from Vazhakulam Pineapple Growers Association(PGA). Price collected can be aptly considered as representative price as most of the pineapple farmers are organized under PGA and trade pineapple through them. The prices represent the farm gate price received by the farmers and it is easily available in the website of Pineapple Growers Association(Pineapple Growers Association 2018). Data on daily prices of pineapple from January 2017 to March 2020 was taken as pre-COVID period and from April 2020 to September 2022 is taken as COVID-post-COVID period. January 2017 to September 2022 was taken as the overall period.\n\n\n2.3 GARCH models\nThe uncertainty surrounding prospective price fluctuation is referred to as volatility. There are different methods to estimate volatility such as historical moving average, Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA), Auto Regressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (ARCH) introduced by Engle (1982) and Generalized Auto-Regressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) introduced by Bollerslev (1986).\nSekhar (2004) compared the price volatility of different agricultural commodities in major Indian and international markets by using GARCH model. This model provided evidence on whether the estimated volatility is statistically significant or not. It also measures the persistence of volatility (Sabu 2015).\nThe ARCH process introduced by Engle (1982) explicitly recognizes the difference between the unconditional and the conditional variance allowing the latter to change over time as a function of past errors. The GARCH model of Bollerslev (1986) is an important type of time series model for heteroscedastic data. It explicitly models a time-varying conditional variance as a linear function of past squared residuals and of its past values. GARCH models are an extension of the ARCH models first introduced by Engle (1982) as it basically introduces a lagged conditional variance to the information set of an ARCH model. An ARCH model applied to price volatility basically assumes that a dependent variable of commodity prices, \\(P_i\\), is generated by the autoregressive process:\n\\[p_i = \\phi_0 + \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\phi_{1} P_{t-1} + \\varepsilon_t \\tag{1}\\]\nTo generate the ARCH\\((p)\\) process, we express the conditional variance of the above expression as a function of its past values squared:\n\\[\\varepsilon_t \\mid \\Omega_{t-1} \\sim N(0, h) \\tag{2}\\]\n\\[h_t^2 = \\delta + \\sum_{i=1}^{p} \\alpha_i \\varepsilon_{t-i}^2 \\tag{3}\\]\nWhere, \\(h_t^2\\) denotes the conditional variance of the information set \\(\\Omega_{t-1}\\) that is available at time \\(t-1\\), and \\(\\delta &gt; 0\\), \\(\\alpha_i \\geq 0\\) for all \\(i = 2 \\ldots p\\) and \\(\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2 + \\cdots + \\alpha_m &lt; 1\\), which are necessary to make \\(\\varepsilon_t^2\\) positive and covariance stationary.\nThe generalization of the ARCH process given in Equation 3 is as follows (Bollerslev 1986):\n\\[\nh_t^2 = \\delta + \\sum_{i=1}^{p} \\alpha_i \\varepsilon_{t-i}^2 + \\sum_{i=1}^{q} \\beta_i h_{t-i}^2\n\\tag{4}\\]\nThe GARCH model in Equation 4 depicts the conditional variance of a price series to depend on a constant, past news about volatility (i.e. the \\(\\varepsilon_{t-1}^2\\) terms). Including the lagged conditional variances might capture the “adaptive learning” phenomenon. The benefit of the GARCH specification is that it contains fewer coefficient restrictions. For a well-defined variance and covariance function: \\(\\delta, \\alpha &gt; 0; \\beta \\geq 0\\), and \\(\\alpha + \\beta &lt; 1\\).\nPersistence of volatility in the commodity series is measured by the sum of \\(\\alpha + \\beta\\). Downward price changes are often followed by higher volatility than upward movements of the same magnitude (Herrera and Espinel 2008).\nModels aim to define volatility clustering and effects such as kurtosis, forming the basis of dynamic volatility models.\nThe key is that volatility, rather than remaining constant or moving in a monotonic manner over time, is dependent on past realisations of the associated volatility i.e. the error variance is related to the squared error terms over several periods in the past (Singh 2020).\nThe ARCH-GARCH model was used to analyse the volatility and it was estimated using R software (R Core Team 2023). From the different models, Standard GARCH (1,1) (SGARCH) model was identified as the best model for this study based on the smallest Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) values (Lestari et al. 2022). This model distinguishes the predictable and unpredictable components of prices and also allows the variance of the unpredictable element to be time-varying. Such time varying conditional variances were estimated by using the SGARCH (1,1) model (Gujarati, Porter, and Gunasekhar 2009) and it was used to identify periods of high volatility.\nThe GARCH(1,1) model is specified as:\n\\[Y_{it} = \\alpha_0 + \\beta_1 P_{t-1} + \\beta_2 P_{t-2} + \\varepsilon_t \\quad ; \\quad t = 1, 2, \\ldots, t \\tag{5}\\]\n\\[\\sigma^2_{i,t} = \\theta + \\alpha_i \\varepsilon^2_{i,t-1} + \\beta_i \\sigma^2_{i,t-1} \\tag{6}\\]\nWhere \\(P_{t-1}\\) is the price at time \\(t-1\\) and \\(\\sigma^2_{i,t}\\) is the conditional error variance at time \\(t\\). The term \\((\\alpha_i + \\beta_i)\\) indicates the degree of persistence in price volatility. If the sum \\((\\alpha_i + \\beta_i)\\) is close to 1, it implies a high level of volatility persistence (Devi, Srikala, and Ananda 2015).\nThe general form of a GARCH(\\(p\\), \\(q\\)) model is:\n\\[\\sigma^2_{i,t} = \\omega + \\sum_{i=1}^{p} \\beta_i \\sigma^2_{t-i} + \\sum_{i=1}^{q} \\alpha_i \\varepsilon^2_{t-i} \\tag{7}\\]\nEquation Equation 5) captures the autoregressive part of the price model, while Equations Equation 6 and Equation 7 describe the time-varying variance component."

    "section": "3 Results",
    "text": "3 Results\n\n3.1 Average monthly prices behaviour\nIn Vazhakulam, fresh pineapple is harvested at two stages: as green pineapple (harvested at 115 days after the ethephon application) and as ripe pineapple (harvested at 120–125 days after the ethephon application).\nThe present study analyzed the price volatility of both ripe and green pineapple using time series data of daily prices from January 2017 to September 2022. For analytical purposes, the data set was divided into the following three periods:\n\nPre-COVID period: January 2017 to March 2020\n\nCOVID–Post-COVID period: April 2020 to September 2022\n\nThe average monthly prices of both green and ripe pineapple during the pre-COVID and COVID–post-COVID periods are presented in Figure 1 (a) and Figure 1 (b), respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Pre-COVID period\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) COVID-Post-COVID period\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Average monthly prices (Rs./kg) of both green and ripe pineapple in Vazhakulam market during pre-covid and post-covid periods\n\n\n\nPrice of pineapple usually stood high during the summer months of April and May coinciding with summer and one-month long Ramdan fasting. So, many farmers targeted the harvest of the crop during these months. But in April 2020, during the first lockdown period due to strict restrictions, many pineapple plantations were abandoned without harvesting. This was mainly due to the unavailability of migrant labours (as they went back to their hometown fearing the disease). So, a steep decline in price was observed during that period. Prices started increasing as the restrictions were lifted gradually. Again in 2021, there was price drop in the months of May and June due to another lockdown and restrictions.\nThe price drop was to the level of Rs. 10/kg, which put farmers in distress. During the survey, many farmers reported that the price of pineapple had even dipped to Rs. 5/kg during the COVID period as they were not able to transport the produce to the Vazhakulam pineapple market. So, they sold produce in nearby markets. Many of the plantations were kept unharvested and harvested fruits fetched only very low price. Restrictions in interstate and intra state transport, fear of spread of virus through the fruits etc. worsened the situation. Many farmers terminated their lease contracts with landowners before expiry due to financial crisis and were unable to pay the lease amount and continue farming operations. Farmers reported that the reduction in the cultivated area had impacted total pineapple production from Vazhakulam. As the restrictions were gradually lifted towards the end of 2021, situation became normal and price hike was observed due to a reduced supply of pineapple to the market, with the demand for pineapple was same as earlier.\n\n\n3.2 Estimation of volatility using GARCH\nGARCH models are very popular in the analysis of price volatility. Standard GARCH(1,1) model was fitted to study the volatility in the prices of pineapple. The estimates of GARCH(1,1) model for ripe pineapple and green pineapple are presented in Table 1 and Table 2.\n\n\n\nTable 1: GARCH(1,1) estimates for ripe pineapple prices in Vazhakulam market.

It indicated that the volatility in the prices of pineapple was persistent despite the COVID-induced lockdown.\nIt is evident from Table 1 that the sum of coefficients \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) for the prices of ripe pineapple was higher in the COVID-post-COVID period, followed by the overall period. This indicated higher volatility in the prices of ripe pineapple during the COVID-post-COVID period. A similar trend was observed in the price of green pineapple (Table 2). This might be related to the reduced demand for pineapple in the market as a result of changes in the consumption behaviour of people during the pandemic. A study conducted by Yu et al. (2020) on the impact of COVID-19 on the prices of major food products in China found that rice and wheat showed no significant changes in prices after the COVID lockdown, whereas prices of cabbage showed higher volatility.\nAmong the green and ripe pineapple prices, higher volatility was observed in the prices of green pineapple as compared to ripe pineapple for all the periods—pre-COVID, COVID-post-COVID, and overall. The value of the \\(\\alpha + \\beta\\) term for green pineapple prices was close to one (0.916) during the post-COVID period, which indicated higher volatility in the prices of green pineapple after the lockdown. This could be because the effect of transportation restrictions during the lockdown on green pineapple was greater as it was marketed to North India, whereas mature ripe pineapple was marketed in Kerala and nearby states. In a similar attempt, while studying the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the prices of rice, chilli, and garlic in Indonesia, it was found that due to the government’s different social assistance programs, the impact of COVID-19 on the prices of rice was negligible, whereas the prices of chilli and garlic had decreased due to the pandemic. The study also found that the effect of COVID-19 on the prices of horticultural products was higher as compared to that on the prices of food grains (Zahraturrahmi et al. 2021).\n\n\n3.3 Volatility clustering\nTo provide more detailed insights in to the volatility in price of pineapple, the volatility clustering in daily prices of both green and ripe pineapple for pre-COVID, COVID-post-COVID and overall periods are shown in Figure 2 given below. These figures clearly underpin the estimated results of GARCH model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Pre-COVID period green pineapple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Pre-COVID period ripe pineapple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) COVID-post-COVID period green pineapple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) COVID-post-COVID period ripe pineapple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(e) Overall period green pineapple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(f) Overall period ripe pineapple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Volatility clustering in daily prices of green and ripe pineapple during pre-COVID, COVID-post-COVID, and overall periods.\n\n\n\nThe Figure 2 indicated that there was volatility in the prices of pineapple. But the volatility was more prominent during the COVID-post-COVID period. A lowest price of Rs.10 per kg was realized during the COVID period and it recovered gradually to Rs.60 per kg during the post-COVID period. According to Pineapple Growers Association Kerala, the farm gate price had come down to Rs.10 per kg compared to Rs.40 in the previous year due to lockdown (Kumar 2020). Thus, the pineapple farmers were in distress and they were unable to pay off their debts. There was also a report of farmer suicide due to financial losses in pineapple cultivation (Government of Kerala 2020b).\nIn a similar attempt, (Kaur 2021) in her study observed persistence of volatility in the prices of cereals, pulses and fruits before and after COVID-19. (Arumugam, Kanagavalli, and Manida 2020) revealed that the problem of labour shortage caused by a fear of viral transmission led to the wastage of harvested commodities, primarily fruits and vegetables, and also demand reduction of produce in the market. In a study conducted by (Pandya et al. 2021), the prices of all agricultural items dropped by about 70 percent due to a rapid drop in demand and an excess supply of farm products. According to (Hossain et al. 2020), COVID-19 not only affected physical health but also affected the mental health of farmers."

    "title": "Impact of COVID Lockdown on Price Volatility of Pineapple in Vazhakulam, Kerala",
    "section": "Discussion",
    "text": "Discussion\nThe present study highlights the significant volatility in pineapple prices across pre-COVID, COVID-post-COVID, and overall periods in the Vazhakulam market. Results from the GARCH(1,1) model indicated that both green and ripe pineapple prices experienced persistent volatility, with a pronounced increase during the COVID-post-COVID period. This was evident from the higher \\(\\alpha + \\beta\\) values observed, especially for green pineapple, suggesting a strong memory in the price volatility process during this period.\nSeveral factors contributed to this heightened volatility. The COVID lockdowns imposed transport and logistics constraints and disrupted supply chains which caused a temporary collapse in market demand. This was reflected in steep price drops, with the price of pineapple falling as low as Rs 10 per kg during the lockdown, as reported by the Pineapple Growers Association (Kumar 2020). The inability to harvest or transport produce due to labour shortages further aggravated the situation (Arumugam, Kanagavalli, and Manida 2020).\nThe findings are consistent with similar studies on other horticultural commodities. (Kaur 2021) found continued volatility in food prices post-COVID, and (Pandya et al. 2021) noted an average price drop of 70% in farm produce during the early pandemic phase. Moreover, the psychological and financial stress induced by the pandemic led to cases of farmer distress and suicide, further underlining the socioeconomic impact (Hossain et al. 2020).\nIt was also evident that green pineapple prices were more volatile than ripe ones, potentially due to their greater dependence on inter-state transport, especially to North Indian markets. These insights underscore the vulnerability of perishable commodity sectors to external shocks and reinforce the need for effective price risk management, timely market intelligence, and supportive agricultural policy interventions."

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nPineapple cultivation remains a remunerative agricultural activity for many farmers in Kerala, particularly because it is one of the major fruit crops transported from the state to other parts of India. This study examined the price volatility in the Vazhakulam pineapple market during the pre-COVID, COVID-post-COVID, and overall periods. Findings revealed that pineapple farmers in Kerala have historically faced frequent price fluctuations, with significantly heightened volatility observed during the COVID-post-COVID period. This increase was primarily attributed to transportation restrictions and a fall in market demand due to the pandemic.\nThese results have important implications for policymakers. To stabilize the pineapple market, there is a need to develop more robust price risk management mechanisms. Although the Government of Kerala has fixed a base price of Rs 15 per kg for pineapple (Government of Kerala 2020b), the study found the average cost of production to be Rs 17.33 per kg. Therefore, it is recommended that the base price be revised to at least Rs 20–22 per kg to ensure profitability. The findings highlight the need for targeted policy support and risk management strategies to stabilize pineapple marketsin Kerala and protect farmer livelihoods during times of crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcknowledgments\n\n\n\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the support and encouragement provided by Kerala Agricultural University. They also sincerely thank the respondent farmers for their valuable time and cooperation during the course of the study."

    "text": "1 Introduction\nIn India, the agricultural waste generated by crops is significantly higher than in many other countries. Due to the lack of suitable technologies for effective disposal, farmers often resort to burning the crop residues as a quick and convenient method to clear fields. According to Singh and Kaskaoutis (2014), about 43% of the total crop stubbles produced in India is burnt in-situ, contributing substantially to air pollution. One promising solution to mitigate the environmental impact of crop residue burning is the conversion of crop residues into biochar, a carbon rich material produced through pyrolysis. Punnoose and Anitha (2015) has reported that biomass possesses several beneficial physical properties including low bulk density, high porosity, and higher water holding capacity. When applied to soil, these properties make biochar, an effective soil conditioner, enhancing both water and nutrient retention in soil and improves the crop yield. In Kerala, tender coconut husk is a prominent form of agricultural waste which requires efficient and ecofriendly disposal methods. Although, a portion of this agricultural waste is currently utilized through composting or as mulch in coconut gardens, these practices are insufficient relative to the large volume of waste produced. The dried tender coconut husk holds significant potential for conversion into biochar, which can then be recycled back into agricultural use to boost soil productivity. The Onattukara tract spread over three districts of Kerala (Alappuzha, Kollam and Pathanamthitta) presents a unique challenge due to its coarse textured, sandy loam soils with inherently low nutrient status. This type of soil is prone to nutrient leaching, especially during rainfall, rendering the applied fertilizers as less effective. Given biochar’s ability to improve soil moisture retention and reduce nutrient leaching, it represents a promising amendment for such type of soils. Therefore, a study was conducted to evaluate the potential of tender coconut husk biochar as a soil conditioner for okra cultivation in the sandy loam soils of Onattukara region."

    "text": "2 Materials and methods\nA field experiment was conducted during the summer of 2023 in the wetlands of the Instructional Farm attached to Onattukara Regional Agricultural Research Station, Kayamkulam, Kerala. The research station is situated at 9.177° North latitude and 76.517° East longitude and at an altitude of 3.05 m above mean sea level. The treatments were laid out in randomized block design comprising of eight treatment combinations of biochar along with two levels of recommended dose of nutrients for okra along with a control and were replicated thrice. The treatments were t1 (biochar @ \\(5\\ \\text{t ha}^{-1}\\) + 100% RDF)1, t2 (biochar @ \\(10\\ \\text{t ha}^{-1}\\) + 100% RDF), t3 (biochar @ \\(5\\ \\text{t ha}^{-1}\\) + \\(5\\ \\text{t ha}^{-1}\\) FYM + 100% RDF)2, t4 (biochar @ \\(10\\ \\text{t ha}^{-1}\\) + \\(5\\ \\text{t ha}^{-1}\\) FYM + 100% RDF), t5 (biochar @ \\(5\\ \\text{t ha}^{-1}\\) + 75% RDF), t6 (biochar @ \\(10\\ \\text{t ha}^{-1}\\) + 75% RDF), t7 (biochar @ \\(5\\ \\text{t ha}^{-1}\\) + \\(5\\ \\text{t ha}^{-1}\\) FYM + 75% RDF), t8 (biochar @ \\(10\\ \\text{t ha}^{-1}\\) + \\(5\\ \\text{t ha}^{-1}\\) FYM + 75% RDF), and t9 (KAU POP (2016)-\\(20\\ \\text{t ha}^{-1}\\) FYM + 100% RDF).\nPrior to sowing, the experimental area was cleared of stubbles and clods were broken thoroughly. Dolomite was applied uniformly at the rate of 1 t ha\\(^{-1}\\) and was incorporated in soil during primary tillage. The field was laid out as per the treatment design. After the layout, biochar and farmyard manure, along with half N, full P and full K of chemical fertilizers were applied in soil as per the treatments just before sowing. The remaining N was given in soil at one month after sowing along with intercultural operations and earthing up. The seeds of okra var. Arka Anamika were sown in lines in the main field at a spacing of 60 cm × 30 cm. The crop was sown during the last week of January 2023. After sowing, uniform population was maintained by thinning and gap filling. Five random plants from each net plot were selected and tagged as observational plants for recording observations.\nThe number of days taken for the first flower to open was noted and the mean was worked out. To find the number of fruits per plant, the fruits obtained from different harvests from each of the five observational plants were recorded separately and the average was worked out. The length of the fruits, from the tip of the fruit to the stalk end, was measured from the observational plants and the average was calculated and expressed in cm. The weight of the fruits harvested from each of the observational plants was recorded after each harvest. After the final harvest, the total weight of fruits obtained from the observational plants at different harvests were worked out, averaged and expressed in kilograms for fruit yield per plant. The weight of fruits from each plot excluding the border plants was recorded after each harvest and summed at the end of the cropping season to compute the yield in terms of kg per plot and was converted into t ha\\(^{-1}\\).\nThe harvest index was calculated using the following formula suggested by Donald and Hamblin (1976). It was calculated by dividing the economic yield with biological yield of the plant. Sample plants collected from each plot were chopped into small pieces and were sun dried. After the initial drying, the samples were dried in oven to attain constant weight. The samples were then ground to pass through a 0.5 mm mesh and the required quantity of samples were digested and used for nutrient analysis following standard procedures. The nutrient uptake was calculated and expressed in kg ha\\(^{-1}\\) according to Equation 1.\n\\[\\text{Nutrient uptake (kg ha}^{-1}\\text{)} = \\frac{\\text{Nutrient content (\\%)} \\times \\text{Dry matter production (kg ha}^{-1}\\text{)}}{100} \\tag{1}\\]\nThe composite soil samples from the field before the experiment and from each plot after the experiment were collected, air dried, powdered and passed through a 2 mm sieve and analysed for physico-chemical properties of the soil (Table 1). The soil samples passed through 0.2 mm sieve were used for organic carbon estimation.

    "text": "3 Results\n\n3.1 Yield and plant performance\nThe application of biochar significantly influenced certain yield traits of okra. Days to flowering ranged between 35 and 37 days after sowing (DAS) across all treatments, but the differences were not statistically significant. Similarly, the number of fruits per plant and fruit length did not differ significantly among treatments. However, fruit yield per plant was significantly affected by biochar application (Table 2). Treatment t4 resulted in the highest fruit yield per plant (\\(544.93\\ \\text{g}\\)) and was statistically at par with t3 (\\(537.74\\ \\text{g}\\)), while the lowest was recorded in t9 (\\(380.24\\ \\text{g}\\)). Yield per hectare followed a similar trend, with t4 yielding \\(15.71\\ \\text{t ha}^{-1}\\) and was found to be on par with t3 (\\(14.07\\ \\text{t ha}^{-1}\\)), and the lowest yield observed in t9 (\\(7.65\\ \\text{t ha}^{-1}\\)). The harvest index was also positively influenced, with t3 registering the highest value (\\(0.81\\)), which was statistically similar to t4 (\\(0.81\\)), t2 (\\(0.79\\)), t1 (\\(0.79\\)), and t8 (\\(0.77\\)).\n\n\n3.2 Nutrient uptake\nThe nutrient uptake of okra plants varied across treatments. Nitrogen uptake was significantly higher in t4 (\\(101.35\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)), which was on par with t3, t2, t6, and t5. The lowest N uptake (\\(74.78\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)) was recorded in t9. Phosphorus uptake was highest in t7 (\\(24.76\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)), statistically similar to t8, t6, t5, and t3, while t2 had the lowest (\\(14.90\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)). Potassium uptake was not significantly affected by any treatment. For calcium, t6 showed the highest uptake (\\(64.94\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)), comparable to t3, t7, and t4. Magnesium uptake was also significantly influenced, with t4 showing the highest uptake (\\(20.47\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)), on par with t3, t6, and t8. Sulphur uptake did not differ significantly across treatments. Copper uptake was highest in t1 (\\(1.82\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)), followed closely by t3 (\\(1.73\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)), while the lowest was in t6 (\\(0.89\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)). Zinc and boron uptakes were not significantly influenced by treatments. Iron uptake was significantly higher in t6 (\\(0.96\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)), which was at par with t1 and t3. Manganese uptake was highest in t8 (\\(1.69\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)), statistically similar to t7, t4, and t2.\n\n\n3.3 Soil properties\nPost-harvest soil analysis revealed that biochar application significantly influenced several soil physico-chemical parameters. Water holding capacity was significantly higher in t4 (\\(33.87\\%\\)), followed by t8, t3, t2, and t7. Bulk density was lowest in t8 (\\(1.21\\ \\text{Mg m}^{-3}\\)), while t9 recorded the highest (\\(1.30\\ \\text{Mg m}^{-3}\\)). No significant differences were found in soil pH, electrical conductivity (EC), or cation exchange capacity (CEC). Organic carbon content increased significantly with biochar application, highest in t4 (\\(1.29\\%\\)), and statistically comparable to t8, t3, t2, t7, t1, and t6. Available nitrogen content also improved, with t4 (\\(209.07\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)) showing significantly higher values, followed by t3, t8, and t7. However, the availability of phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sulphur, copper, zinc, iron, boron, and manganese in the soil was not significantly affected by the treatments.\n\n\n\nTable 2: Effect of treatments on the yield attributes and yield of okra\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTreatment\nDays to Flowering\nNo. of Fruits/Plant\nFruit Length (cm)\nFruit Yield/Plant (g)\nFruit Yield (\\(\\text{t ha}^{-1}\\))\nHarvest Index\n\n\n\n\nt1\n38.67\n18.00\n15.90\n480.30\n10.44\n0.79\n\n\nt2\n38.67\n18.12\n16.07\n487.23\n12.25\n0.79\n\n\nt3\n38.44\n19.90\n16.28\n537.74\n14.07\n0.81\n\n\nt4\n38.67\n20.23\n16.34\n544.93\n15.71\n0.81\n\n\nt5\n38.67\n16.11\n15.55\n392.85\n11.26\n0.74\n\n\nt6\n38.78\n16.79\n15.74\n415.59\n11.89\n0.76\n\n\nt7\n38.89\n17.45\n15.81\n457.61\n12.19\n0.77\n\n\nt8\n38.67\n17.56\n15.85\n464.61\n13.05\n0.77\n\n\nt9\n38.67\n16.11\n15.40\n380.24\n7.65\n0.75\n\n\nSEm (±)\n0.14\n1.33\n0.35\n16.81\n0.63\n0.01\n\n\nCD (0.05)\nNS\nNS\nNS\n50.385\n1.890\n0.037\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Effect of treatments on nutrient uptake of okra (N, P, and K)\n\n\n\n\n\nTreatment\nN (kg ha\\(^{-1}\\))\nP (kg ha\\(^{-1}\\))\nK (kg ha\\(^{-1}\\))\n\n\n\n\nt1\n87.85\n17.07\n51.93\n\n\nt2\n92.90\n14.90\n49.52\n\n\nt3\n95.93\n19.60\n53.88\n\n\nt4\n101.35\n18.45\n46.64\n\n\nt5\n91.93\n19.98\n46.68\n\n\nt6\n92.70\n22.57\n55.40\n\n\nt7\n88.15\n24.76\n46.47\n\n\nt8\n84.43\n23.73\n50.65\n\n\nt9\n74.78\n17.87\n45.96\n\n\nSEm (±)\n4.29\n1.86\n3.42\n\n\nCD (0.05)\n12.848\n5.561\nNS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4: Effect of treatments on uptake of nutrients by okra (all values in kg ha\\(^{-1}\\))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTreatment\nCa\nMg\nS\nCu\nZn\nFe\nB\nMn\n\n\n\n\nt1\n53.28\n18.27\n3.00\n1.82\n1.86\n0.88\n0.30\n1.36\n\n\nt2\n52.78\n18.00\n3.10\n1.70\n1.83\n0.47\n0.34\n1.46\n\n\nt3\n59.72\n19.84\n3.06\n1.73\n1.85\n0.82\n0.32\n1.40\n\n\nt4\n58.61\n20.47\n3.14\n1.19\n1.92\n0.44\n0.34\n1.67\n\n\nt5\n54.39\n16.54\n3.03\n0.67\n1.92\n0.67\n0.30\n1.42\n\n\nt6\n64.94\n19.61\n3.05\n0.89\n1.85\n0.96\n0.33\n1.61\n\n\nt7\n59.38\n18.66\n2.98\n1.09\n2.04\n0.74\n0.31\n1.68\n\n\nt8\n56.25\n19.60\n3.07\n1.34\n2.01\n0.78\n0.33\n1.69\n\n\nt9\n41.10\n18.68\n2.98\n1.68\n1.93\n0.78\n0.31\n1.39\n\n\nSEm (±)\n2.21\n0.35\n0.05\n0.04\n0.18\n0.05\n0.02\n0.08\n\n\nCD (0.05)\n6.610\n1.061\nNS\n0.111\nNS\n0.151\nNS\n0.251\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5: Effect of treatments on soil parameters after harvest of okra\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTreatment\nWHC (%)\nBulk Density (Mg m\\(^{-3}\\))\npH\nEC (dS m\\(^{-1}\\))\nCEC (cmol(+) kg\\(^{-1}\\))\nOrganic Carbon (%)\n\n\n\n\nt1\n30.78\n1.26\n5.48\n0.03\n3.11\n1.19\n\n\nt2\n32.65\n1.22\n5.78\n0.03\n3.12\n1.23\n\n\nt3\n32.73\n1.23\n5.59\n0.02\n3.06\n1.25\n\n\nt4\n33.87\n1.22\n5.87\n0.03\n3.11\n1.29\n\n\nt5\n29.45\n1.24\n5.66\n0.02\n3.08\n1.10\n\n\nt6\n30.91\n1.22\n5.76\n0.09\n3.09\n1.17\n\n\nt7\n32.61\n1.22\n5.67\n0.04\n3.11\n1.23\n\n\nt8\n33.02\n1.21\n5.84\n0.02\n3.07\n1.26\n\n\nt9\n27.52\n1.30\n5.31\n0.03\n3.05\n0.96\n\n\nSEm (±)\n0.57\n0.00\n0.11\n0.03\n0.04\n0.05\n\n\nCD (0.05)\n1.695\n0.008\nNS\nNS\nNS\n0.134\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 6: Effect of treatments on primary nutrient status of soil after the experiment (all values in kg ha\\(^{-1}\\))\n\n\n\n\n\nTreatment\nAvailable N\nAvailable P\nAvailable K\n\n\n\n\nt1\n188.16\n76.91\n161.43\n\n\nt2\n188.16\n79.63\n152.13\n\n\nt3\n196.52\n76.36\n146.46\n\n\nt4\n209.07\n94.90\n172.70\n\n\nt5\n163.07\n80.72\n189.47\n\n\nt6\n163.07\n82.73\n159.64\n\n\nt7\n196.52\n88.00\n172.03\n\n\nt8\n196.52\n75.09\n173.26\n\n\nt9\n183.98\n73.63\n149.74\n\n\nSEm (±)\n6.97\n7.08\n10.63\n\n\nCD (0.05)\n20.890\nNS\nNS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 7: Effect of treatments on secondary and micronutrient status of soil after the experiment (all values in mg kg\\(^{-1}\\))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTreatment\nEx.3 Ca\nEx.

    "section": "4 Discussion",
    "text": "4 Discussion\n\n4.1 Yield attributes\nThe treatments did not influence the days taken to flower in okra. In general, regardless of the treatments, the okra plants started to flower between 35 DAS and 37 DAS. The number of fruits per plant and length of fruits were not influenced by biochar. However, the fruit yield per plant was significantly improved by the incorporation of biochar. The highest yield per plant was obtained from t4 (\\(544.93\\ \\text{g}\\)) and was found to be on a par with the treatment t3 (\\(537.74\\ \\text{g}\\) per plant). There was 35.60 per cent increase over t9. Higher fruit yield per plant was observed for the plants that received biochar and FYM along with 100 per cent recommended dose of fertilizers (RDF). The adsorbing property of biochar in sandy loam soil might have slowed down the release of nutrients from FYM and chemical fertilizers. As the amount of biochar was doubled, there was an increase in fresh weight of fruits. This is in accordance with the findings of Dainy (2015) who also reported a progressive increment in the yield characters in yard long bean as the levels of biochar was enhanced from 10 to 30 t ha\\(^{-1}\\) when applied along with the recommended dose of fertilizers. Similar reports of increased yield with the incorporation of biochar and RDF were also reported by Punnoose (2015) in amaranthus and Hashmi et al. (2019) in Pisum sativum L. In the case of fruit yield ha\\(^{-1}\\), the application of tender coconut husk biochar had significantly improved the yield per hectare in okra. Higher fruit yield per hectare was observed for the treatment t4 (\\(15.71\\ \\text{t}\\)) and was on par with t3 (\\(14.07\\ \\text{t}\\)). The control plants (t9) could only produce \\(7.65\\ \\text{t ha}^{-1}\\). Overall, there was a yield increase of 69 per cent in t4 compared to t9. The lower yield in t9 might be due to the leaching loss of nutrients. There was 44 mm rainfall during the growth period of okra at Onattukara which might have aggravated the leaching loss in the sandy loam soils of Onattukara. Nagula (2017) had also recommended the application of biochar (\\(@\\) 10 kg ha\\(^{-1}\\)) along with RDN for higher yield in banana. The harvest index was also significantly influenced by the treatments. The treatment t3 recorded a higher harvest index of \\(0.81\\) and was found to be on a par with the treatments t4 (\\(0.81\\)), t2 (\\(0.79\\)), t1 (\\(0.79\\)) and t8 (\\(0.77\\)). Thus, biochar as a soil conditioner along with FYM and full recommended dose of fertilizers was effective for okra in the sandy loam soils of Onattukara.\n\n\n4.2 Nutrient uptake\nThe N uptake in okra was significantly improved due to the treatments. Among the treatments, the highest N uptake was recorded by the treatment t4 (\\(101.35\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)) and was found to be on a par with t3 (\\(95.93\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)), t2 (\\(92.90\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)), t6 (\\(92.70\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)) and t5 (\\(91.93\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)). Lower N uptake was recorded in t9. There was an increase of 30.14 percent in the N uptake (t4) compared to control (t9). This might be due to the adsorbing capacity of biochar applied as soil conditioner. The higher CEC for biochar might have helped in retaining N in the sandy loam soils of Onattukara. The full RDN along with FYM (5 t ha\\(^{-1}\\)), combined with the adsorbing property of biochar might have contributed to a higher status of available N in soil and led to an increased uptake of N by okra. Dainy (2015) had earlier reported that the total N uptake in yard long bean was found to increase from \\(51.19\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\) to \\(105.50\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\) due to the application of biochar, PGPR and full recommended dose of nutrients. Jabin (2022) had also reported that total N uptake was higher in ginger when treated with paddy husk biochar (30 t ha\\(^{-1}\\)) along with full dose of fertilizers in sandy soils. Similarly, Nigussie et al. (2012) had also reported a higher N uptake in lettuces grown in soils conditioned with 10 t ha\\(^{-1}\\) biochar suggesting the prospects of biochar to raise fertilizer use efficiency in soils where N loss is high.\nA significant difference was observed in P uptake among the treatments. Higher P uptake was observed for t7 (\\(24.76\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)) and was on a par with t8 (\\(23.73\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)), t6 (\\(22.57\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)), t5 (\\(19.98\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)) and t3 (\\(19.60\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)). This increase in P uptake might be due to the higher quantity of available P in soil which is evident from the soil samples collected after the harvest of okra (Table 6). In acidic soils, the solubility of P and its uptake by plants depends mainly on the formation of Al and Fe-phosphates in soil. When biochar is applied to acidic soil condition, it raises the soil pH. There is a reduction in the P binding to Fe and Al oxides, thus making P available in soil. Similar reports of improved P availability in acid soils due to supplementation of biochar was observed by Chintala et al. (2014) and H. Zhang et al. (2016). On the contrary, Dainy (2015) and Jabin (2022) had reported a higher P uptake in yard long bean and ginger, treated with biochar along with NPK as per KAU POP (2016). The uptake of K was not significantly influenced by the treatments.\nSignificant effect for Ca uptake was observed in okra (Table 4). The highest Ca uptake was recorded by the treatment t6 (\\(64.94\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)) and was noticed to be on a par with treatment t3 (\\(59.72\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)), t7 (\\(59.38\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)) and t4 (\\(58.61\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)). Lower Ca uptake was recorded by the treatment t9 (KAU POP). There was an overall increase of calcium uptake by 44.96% in t6 compared to the control t9. The application of biochar along with liming prior to planting okra was found to improve the availability of calcium in soil which might have led to an increased plant uptake. Earlier, Sombroek, Nachtergaele, and Hebel (1993) had also reported increased calcium availability for plant growth after the application of biochar due to the higher surface area, negative surface charge and charge density. Moreover, calcium in biochar may exchange Al ions present on the soil organic matter and enhance the availability of calcium for plants thus, guiding it to an increased calcium uptake by the plants (Novak et al. 2009). Dainy (2015) had also reported higher Ca uptake in yard long bean due to the application of biochar. In sandy soils, Jabin (2022) also observed a higher calcium uptake in ginger.\nThe uptake of Mg was observed to be significant (Table 4). The treatment t4 resulted in higher Mg uptake (\\(20.47\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)) by okra and was noticed to be on a par with the treatment t3 (\\(19.84\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)), t6 (\\(19.61\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)) and t8 (\\(19.60\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)). The Mg in soil increases with increase in soil pH. There was an increment in soil pH from the initial value of 5.38 (Table 1) to 5.87 (Table 5) due to application of biochar in combination with the effect of liming. This might have improved the exchangeable magnesium in soil which has resulted in an increased magnesium uptake in okra. Jabin (2022) has also reported an increased magnesium uptake in ginger due to application of biochar. Tender coconut husk biochar had 0.13 percent magnesium (Vikram et al. 2024). This might have contributed to the higher magnesium content in t4. Dainy (2015) had also reported an increase in total Mg uptake in yard long bean when biochar (@ 20 t ha\\(^{-1}\\)) was applied with RDN. The uptake of sulphur was not significantly influenced by the treatments.\nCopper uptake was found to be significant (Table 4) for the treatments. Higher copper uptake in okra was observed for the treatment t1 (\\(1.82\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)) and was found to be on a par with the treatment t3 (\\(1.73\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)). There was an increase in copper content in soil from \\(1.31\\ \\text{mg kg}^{-1}\\) (Table 1) to \\(1.45\\ \\text{mg kg}^{-1}\\) (Table 7) due to the application of biochar. This might have contributed to the increased uptake of copper in okra. Similar reports of increased copper uptake were noticed in yard long beans by Dainy (2015) and in rice by Salvacion and Pangga (2020) due to the application of biochar.\nThe uptake of zinc was not significantly influenced by the treatments. The uptake of iron in okra was found to be significant (Table 4). Higher iron uptake was observed for t6 (\\(0.96\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)) and was perceived to be on a par with treatment t1 (\\(0.88\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)) and t3 (\\(0.82\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)). The biochar produced from tender coconut husk contains \\(107.58\\ \\text{mg kg}^{-1}\\) of iron (Vikram et al. 2024), and hence its application as a soil conditioner had increased the soil iron content. The initial soil available iron was \\(14.74\\ \\text{mg kg}^{-1}\\) (Table 1) and was increased to \\(15.53\\ \\text{mg kg}^{-1}\\) (t6 – Table 7) due to the application of biochar. This might be the reason for the increased availability of iron in soil which might have contributed to the increased iron uptake in t6 treatment. Similar report of increased iron uptake in yard long bean was observed by Dainy (2015).\nThe uptake of boron was not significantly influenced by the treatments. The uptake of manganese was found to be significantly influenced by the treatments (Table 4). Among the treatments, the highest uptake of manganese was recorded by the treatment t8 (\\(1.69\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)) and was observed to be on a par with treatment t7 (\\(1.68\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)), t4 (\\(1.67\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)), t6 (\\(1.61\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)) and t2 (\\(1.46\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)). The application of biochar had slightly improved the soil available manganese. This might have improved the plant uptake of manganese in okra. Earlier, Dainy (2015) had also reported the increase in total uptake of manganese from \\(559.93\\) to \\(1140.50\\ \\text{g ha}^{-1}\\) due to application of biochar in yard long bean."

    "text": "5 Soil attributes\nThe soil water holding capacity after cultivation of okra was significantly modified due to the treatments. The initial water holding capacity of the soil from the experimental area (Table 1) was \\(10.47\\%\\). The treatment t4 recorded a significantly higher WHC (\\(33.87\\%\\)) and was found on a par with t8 (\\(33.02\\%\\)), t3 (\\(32.73\\%\\)), t2 (\\(32.65\\%\\)) and t7 (\\(32.61\\%\\)). An increase of \\(20.68\\%\\) in water holding capacity was observed in t4 (compared to control). An overall increase of \\(105.55\\%\\) of WHC could be obtained due to application of biochar in the sandy loam soils of Onattukara. The initial analysis of tender coconut husk biochar had revealed that it had a water holding capacity of \\(232.34\\%\\). This biochar when applied to soil reduces the bulk density of soil and is the reason for the higher water holding capacity of the soil. There was \\(57.92\\%\\) increase in WHC with the application of biochar along with NPK as per POP recommendation (Dainy 2015). Wang et al. (2019) has also reported that biochar can temporarily increase the field capacity due to their higher pore volume in a coarse textured soil.\nThe bulk density of soil was found to be significantly reduced by the treatments. The initial bulk density of the soil from the experimental area was \\(1.61\\ \\text{Mg m}^{-3}\\). In general, biochar had significantly reduced the soil’s bulk density. KAU 2016 (t9) recorded the highest bulk density (\\(1.30\\ \\text{Mg m}^{-3}\\)) in soil and the lowest was recorded for the treatment t8 (\\(1.21\\ \\text{Mg m}^{-3}\\)). Overall, there was a reduction in bulk density by \\(28.37\\%\\) compared to the initial value indicating the potential for increased water holding capacity. There are several reports of decreased bulk density with application of biochar (Laird et al. 2010; Jones, Haynes, and Phillips 2010; Chen et al. 2011; Mankasingh, Choi, and Ragnarsdottir 2011; A. Zhang et al. 2012). Dainy (2015) had also reported in yard long bean that the application of biochar had lowered the bulk density of soil. The pH, electrical conductivity and CEC in soil after the experiment was not significantly influenced by the treatments.\nThe organic carbon content of the soil after the experiment was significantly governed by the treatments. Higher organic carbon was noticed for t4 (\\(1.29\\%\\)) and was on par with t8 (\\(1.26\\%\\)), t3 (\\(1.25\\%\\)), t2 (\\(1.23\\%\\)), t7 (\\(1.23\\%\\)), t1 (\\(1.19\\%\\)) and t6 (\\(1.17\\%\\)). The control treatment (t9) recorded the lowest organic carbon content (\\(0.96\\%\\)). There was an overall increase of \\(29.33\\%\\) in t4 compared to KAU (2016) due to the application of biochar. The initial organic carbon content in soil before the experiment was \\(0.53\\%\\) (Table 1). Biochar produced from tender coconut husk had a total organic carbon content of \\(48.14\\%\\) (Vikram et al. 2024), and application of this might have helped in the increased carbon content in biochar applied plants. In amaranthus, Punnoose and Anitha (2015) had also reported higher organic carbon content in biochar applied plants.\nThere were significant effects on available N in soil. Higher available N was observed for t4 (\\(209.07\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)) and was on a par with the treatments t3, t7 and t8 with \\(196.52\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\). This might be due to the increased retention of nitrogen in soil due to the application of biochar. Punnoose (2015) had also reported an increased nutrient content in biochar applied soils. The control (t9) recorded an available N content of \\(183.98\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\). There was \\(44\\ \\text{mm}\\) of rain during the crop period which might have leached out the available N in soil leading to a comparatively lesser available N in soil. The lowest available N was recorded for t5 and t6 with \\(163.07\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\). The lower dose of fertilizer without the application of FYM might have led to the lowest available N in soil."

    "text": "1 Introduction\nIn the post-globalization era, many countries witnessed high momentum in economic growth. However, this rapid growth failed to provide the much-needed ‘trickle-down’ effect at the expected rate. The unequal growth of different sectors exacerbated poverty and income inequality. Generally, poor people adopt various livelihood strategies such as smallholder entrepreneurship, participation in agricultural and non-farm labour markets, and migration to overcome poverty (World Bank 2007). The decision to adopt particular strategies is influenced by access to resources and gender power relations within the community and household.\nIn recent decades, the Indian agriculture sector has experienced a high level of feminization, accelerating rapidly. The poverty-induced shift of the male population from farm to non-farm activities for sustenance and better income is quite evident in the country’s economy (Itishree et al. 2018). Therefore, providing credit and other input facilities to women is considered an important policy intervention for poverty alleviation and agricultural development in the country.\nFinancial inclusion—bringing all sections of society, regardless of socio-economic status, into the formal financial system—plays a pivotal role in any nation’s holistic development. The inclusion of marginalized sections of society in formal financial institutions is a critical prerequisite for eradicating poverty and fostering economic growth (Demirguc-Kunt, Levine, and Detragiache 2008; Rangarajan 2008). Various studies have pointed out that countries with higher levels of financial inclusion exhibit better GDP growth rates (Demirguc-Kunt and Levine 2009).\nThe microfinance movement has played a crucial role in addressing this national issue and has emerged as the single largest saviour of the rural poor from financial exclusion, especially for women. Among the different models, the Self-Help Group (SHG)-led microfinance model has evolved into the most prominent channel for financial inclusion and has become an integral and inevitable component of the rural economy in India (Dhar 2016). Ideally, poor people can invest small amounts in micro-enterprises to generate income for their livelihood. SHGs have been financing both income-generating and consumption-related needs of members. However, various studies have shown that earlier credit requirements were often used for consumption purposes (Sooryamoorthy 2007; Vasantha 2014).\nAmong income-generating activities, dairy enterprises are especially popular among farmers due to their familiarity with dairying and the opportunity for year-round cash flow, which facilitates easy loan repayment. The performance of SHGs in southern Indian states has been commendable in terms of loan repayment rates and the velocity of lending. In particular, the SHG movement in Kerala has gained significant attention due to its active role in the state’s poverty eradication programmes. A study on women’s participation in agriculture and allied activities found that over 95% of the work in the animal husbandry sector in rural Kerala was performed by women (Geethakutty et al. 2014). Furthermore, refinancing of dairy loans shows a positive trend and holds vast potential for enhancing the employment and income of poor households, especially women (NABARD 2019).\nThe factors affecting the repayment performance of SHGs require thorough investigation, as they depend on multiple socioeconomic variables. Since only a limited number of empirical studies have examined the influence of such factors in India, this paper explores the group performance of SHGs and investigates the determinants of their repayment behaviour."

    "text": "2 Materials and methods\nThe SHG movement in the study state, Kerala, began with the Kudumbashree Mission, which was implemented two decades ago with strong support from the state government. This study made use of both primary and secondary data. The secondary data regarding the dairy based SHG’s were collected from the State Poverty Eradication Mission of the Government of Kerala and also from its district offices. The primary data were collected from both SHG members and non-members during the period 2020–21.\nIn accordance with the objectives, a multistage random sampling technique was adopted. The high-altitude agro-economic zone was purposively selected due to the presence of a large number of dairy-financed SHGs in the area. From this zone, Idukki and Wayanad districts were selected purposively, as they are predominantly rural and host the highest number of dairy-financed SHGs.\nFurther, two blocks each were randomly selected from these districts: Nedumkandam and Adimaly from Idukki, and Mananthavady and Kalpetta from Wayanad. Only groups that had availed of dairy loans and had a minimum of three years of experience were included in the sample, based on the assumption that benefits of SHG participation would be meaningfully reflected over that time. From each selected block, 20 women SHGs were randomly chosen, resulting in a total sample of 80 groups.\nData on group performance—such as frequency of meetings, planned savings, transaction costs incurred, savings accumulated, interest rate charged, bank linkage loans availed, repayment schedule, income-generating activities financed, group size, financial inclusion status, and socio-economic profile of members—were collected through interviews with SHG leaders and inspection of register books.\nLoan performance was assessed using both internal and external loan indicators, considering the average of the past two years. Intragroup lending performance was measured by the percentage of members who received internal loans annually. Repayment performance was assessed by the ratio of the amount repaid to the amount due (credit plus interest), separately for internal group loans (from group savings) and external bank linkage loans (from formal financial institutions).\nThe key performance indicators were calculated as follows:\n\\[\\text{Saving performance} = \\frac{\\text{Actual Savings}}{\\text{Planned Savings}} \\tag{1}\\]\n\\[\\text{Repayment rate} = \\frac{\\text{Amount Repaid}}{\\text{Credit} + \\text{Interest}} \\tag{2}\\]\nThe delinquency rate was used as a proxy for repayment performance and was computed using Equation 3.\n\\[\\text{Delinquency rate} = \\frac{\\text{Volume of Loans in Arrears}}{\\text{Total Loan Volume on Promised Date}} \\tag{3}\\]\nA delinquency rate of 0 indicates complete repayment on schedule, while a value of 1 indicates complete delinquency. This measure follows the approach suggested by (Sharma and Zeller 1997) and (Feroze et al. 2011).\nThe factors affecting the delinquency rate were estimated using the Tobit maximum likelihood estimation technique, considering the censored nature of the dependent variable.\n\n2.1 Tobit Model Specification\nTOBIT maximum likelihood technique: The function for delinquency rate was defined as in Equation 4\n\\[\\text{DELQR} = f(\\text{LAMNT}, X) \\tag{4}\\]\n\\(\\text{LAMNT}\\) is the amount of loan in rupees and \\(X\\) is vector for group and community variables . The function is defined for \\(\\text{LAMNT}&gt;0\\). The assumption is as shown in Equation 5 \\[\\lim_{\\text{LAMNT} \\to 0} \\text{DELQR} = 0  \\tag{5}\\]\nSince defaults of small loan are likely to be zero. Hence, the dependent variable is truncated to zero when the group is having prompt repayment. The equation is specified as in Equation 6.\n\\[\\text{DELQR}_i^* = \\beta_1 + + \\beta_2 X_{2i} +  \\varepsilon_i \\tag{6}\\]\n\\[\\text{DELQR}_i =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\text{DELQR}_i^*, & \\text{if } \\text{DELQR}_i^* &gt; 0 \\\\\n0, & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\\]\n\\(\\text{DELQR}_i^*\\) is a latent variable observable when it takes a positive value.\nEquation 6 was estimated using the maximum likelihood technique (Maddala 1983). The explanatory variables used in the TOBIT model are listed in Table 1 along with its expected sign.\n\n\n\nTable 1: Measurement and expected signs of explanatory variables used in the Tobit regression model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplanatory Variable\nMeasurement\nExpected Sign\n\n\n\n\nPeer Monitoring (PM)\nFrequency of meetings per year\n–\n\n\nPeer Pressure (PP)\nPP = 1 if group members exert pressure in case of default; 0 otherwise\n±\n\n\nDegree of Self Selection (SS)\nScale measuring SS in terms of ex-ante and ex-post member selection\n–\n\n\nHomogeneity / Social Ties (HOMO)\nScale measuring group homogeneity by age, religion, marital status, education, occupation, and landholding size\n±\n\n\nGroup Size (GS)\nNumber of group members\n–\n\n\nDependency Ratio (DR)\nProportion of children in total household size\n+\n\n\nLoan Amount Limit (LONAM)\nMaximum individual loan lending limit in ₹\n+\n\n\nWorking Experience (WEXP)\nAge of the group in months\n–"

    "text": "3 Results\nThe studies pointed out that the tenure of group establishment had a significant role in the group’s overall performance (APMAS 2017; Satyasai, Sahoo, and Smita 2014). Hence, the total of 80 groups was post-classified based on their years of operation into three categories using the cumulative square root frequency method (Table 2). As per this criterion, the number of groups falling under IMG (4–8 years), MMG (9–13 years), and LMG (&gt;13 years) categories was 30 (37.50%), 28 (35.00%), and 22 (27.50%), respectively.\n\n\n\nTable 2: Classification of SHGs based on the tenure of establishment (Figures in parentheses indicate the percentage of the total number of groups)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory\nIdukki District\nWayanad District\nOverall\n\n\n\n\nInitial Matured Groups (IMG) (4–8 yrs)\n13 (32.50)\n17 (42.50)\n30 (37.50)\n\n\nMedium Matured Groups (MMG) (9–13 yrs)\n14 (35.00)\n14 (35.00)\n28 (35.00)\n\n\nLong Matured Groups (LMG) (&gt;13 yrs)\n13 (32.50)\n9 (22.50)\n22 (27.50)\n\n\nOverall\n40 (100.00)\n40 (100.00)\n80 (100.00)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe saving performance of groups was evaluated by comparing the planned savings amount with the actual savings amount. The pre-decided/agreed amount of savings in respective groups was considered as planned savings amount. The details of category wise saving performance are elaborated in Table 3. From Table 3, it is well observable that average cumulative savings per member was Rs.19803 in the overall category and it varied from Rs.13161 of IMG category to Rs. 26040 of the LMG category. The average planned savings per group was worked out as Rs. 306812 over the years and the average achievement in the targeted amount was found to be Rs.295593. The savings performance ratio in the overall category was found to be 0.9665, which implies that 96.65 per cent achievement in the pre-planned amount. The high saving ratio of the selected SHGs showed a better level of financial decorum maintained by the groups in savings amount accumulation. The improved economic background of the state and livelihood options provided through microfinance activities could be the possible reason for the high saving performance in the study area. In contrast, the saving ratio reported by the other studies was quite low and it ranges from 71 per cent to 74 per cent only (Verhelle and Berlage 2003; Feroze and Chauhan 2010). The detailed analysis across different age group categories showed that the saving performance of initial matured groups (98.11%) was relatively higher than the elder category groups. The divergence in the savings amount was observed in some groups mainly because of the adjustments of group savings to the outstanding loan arrears. The trend was observed more in elder category groups than younger ones. Such undesirable practices may affect the self-sustainability of groups in the long run.\n\n\n\nTable 3: Saving performance of SHGs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticulars\nIMG\nMMG\nLMG\nOverall\n\n\n\n\n1.

Even though the external bank linkage loan was taken in the name of generating productive purposes, its utilization was found to be diverted from the intended objectives. The utilization of external bank linkage loans across different portfolios is detailed in Table 4. It could be seen from Table 4 that 24.85 per cent of the availed loan was utilized for agricultural and allied activities and 10.58 per cent for the business purposes. The remaining 64.57 per cent of the loan availed was utilized for different consumption purposes. Among that loans, the maximum proportion of the loan was availed for meeting the requirements of children’s education (19.90%) followed by medical expenses (16.12%), household expenses (14.36%), and marriage and festival expenses (8.31%), respectively. The observations of the study found consistent with the findings of (Kumar 2013), in which he reported that 70 per cent of the availed SHG loan was utilized for personal consumption purposes rather than financing income generation activities in Kerala.\n\n\n\nTable 4: Purpose of internal loan taken\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSl.

On average, groups were capable of disbursing internal loans amounting to Rs. 370099 per annum in the study area. Among them, the long-matured groups’ loan magnitude was distinctly high, at Rs. 465506 per annum, due to the larger corpus fund availability. The tenure of establishment also influenced the magnitude of loan per member, which varied from Rs. 18100 to Rs. 31123 across different age group categories, with an overall average of Rs. 24844 per annum. The outreach of internal loans was found to be 95.24 per cent in the initially matured groups and increased to 99.32 per cent in elder (LMG) groups, with an overall average of 97.32 per cent. The analysis of internal loaning performance implies that the groups in the area were able to distribute their thrift money in a well-equitable manner.\nThe SHGs were availing loans from formal financial institutions to meet members’ extra financial requirements. The grading of groups was a mandatory criterion followed by the banks for the approval of bank linkage loans. The loan application from each group went through a three-level monitoring mechanism of the Kudumbashree Mission—namely, the Area Development Societies (ADS) committee at the panchayat ward level and the Community Development Society (CDS) committee at the panchayat level—for scrutiny. A recommendation letter from the CDS chairperson was a mandatory document for availing the bank linkage loan for SHGs. Such high-level scrutiny also helped banks assess the repayment capacity of each group.\nThe bank charged compound interest as per prevailing lending norms, which ranged from 11 to 13 per cent, based on the loan amount and the repayment duration chosen by the group. However, the groups were eligible for an interest subsidy of up to 7 per cent under the National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) interest subvention scheme. An additional 3 per cent interest subvention was provided by the state government to all Women SHGs (WSHGs) in the state.\nThe study observed that out of the total 80 groups, 4 groups (5%) had not availed any kind of bank credit in the past two years. The lack of consensus among members and risk-averse behaviour of these groups was reported as the reason, despite all groups having accessed at least one bank linkage since their inception. A maximum of eight linkages was observed among the selected SHGs. The processing time for loan applications was reported to be less than one month in the study area, and the repayment period of term loans varied from 3 to 5 years, depending on the loan amount.\n\n\n\nTable 5: Loaning performance of SHGs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticulars\nIMG\nMMG\nLMG\nOverall\n\n\n\n\nInternal loaning performance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

The credit-thrift ratio of the availed loans was computed to be 2.22:1, 1.75:1, and 1.57:1 in IMG, MMG, and LMG categories, respectively. The recently formed groups have a lesser amount of thrift and a huge demand for working capital, which could be the possible reason for the higher credit-thrift ratio in the IMG category. The credit–thrift ratio of SHG linkage loans reported by different studies varied from 1.4:1 to 6:1 (Satyasai, Sahoo, and Smita 2014; Verhelle and Berlage 2003; Feroze and Chauhan 2010). The ratio in the elder groups was not found impressive; this was due to the ceiling on lending (Rs. 10 lakhs/group) fixed by the banks and also possibly due to the availability of high corpus funds with these groups.\nThe repayment period of internal loans varied from three months to two years in the selected SHGs. The interest rate of the internal loan has been decided as per the groups’ consensus and is being collected monthly. In the study area, the groups were charging 12 per cent simple interest for the internal group loan, i.e., 1 per cent per month. The demand for internal loans is high because of ease of availability, flexibility in the repayment schedule, and attractiveness in the interest rate. The maximum individual lending limit of the internal loan is updated based on the corpus fund availability and members’ demand. It was observed that the maximum lending limit of the internal loan amount ranged from Rs. 20000 to Rs. 75000 per member in the selected groups.\n\n\n\nTable 6: Loan repayment performance and Savings Bank Account Penetration (SBAP) of SHGs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticulars\nIMG\nMMG\nLMG\nOverall\n\n\n\n\na) Internal loan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

Although the SHGs nominally fixed the installment amount for monthly repayments, in practice, members repay their loans without any fixed installment schedule. The average repayment rate (Table 6) of the internal loan was found to be 87.81 per cent, 87.16 per cent, and 84.62 per cent in initial, medium, and long matured category groups, respectively, with an overall average of 86.72 per cent. The category-wise analysis indicated that the delinquency rate was high in the case of the LMG category compared to the younger groups. These findings were in line with the observations of (Nedumaran, Palanisami, and Swaminathan 2001; Feroze et al. 2011; APMAS 2017), where they reported that repayment of internal group loans faces more challenges than repayment of external bank linkage loans. The utilization of loans for consumption purposes and flexibility in the loan repayment might be the plausible reason for the poor repayment rate of internal group loans in the study area. Besides that, the monitoring agencies of the SHGs were more concerned about the prompt repayment of the external loan amount and least bothered about the overall repayment scenario of the groups.\nThe SHGs have been keeping separate accounts for external bank linkage loans. It was observed that the groups in the study area were not charging any extra commission for the external bank linkage loan from its members. The availed bank loan amount has been distributed within the group as per the members’ requirement. The disbursed amount varied from Rs. 15000 to Rs. 100000 per member in the sampled SHGs as per the members’ requirements. The analysis of external loan repayment revealed that the repayment rate of the bank linkage loan was quite impressive in the sampled SHGs, with an overall average of 99.24 per cent. Out of the total 80 SHGs, only 7 SHGs were facing some level of challenges in the prompt loan repayment. The groups were eligible for the back-end subsidy for prompt loan repayment, which motivates the members for timely repayment. Moreover, the banks were more stringent in penalizing defaulters, which increases the burden on all the members and automatically creates peer pressure.\nThe opening of individual savings bank accounts has been considered a prerequisite for the economic empowerment of women (Satyasai, Sahoo, and Smita 2014). The role of SHGs in the financial inclusion of members was also captured through the savings bank account penetration ratio (SBAP), i.e., the proportion of members having an individual savings bank account to the total. On average, more than 90 per cent of the group members had their own individual savings bank account in the selected SHGs. The highest SBAP ratio was observed in the LMG (96.04%) category, followed by MMG and IMG category groups. The financial literacy earned through SHG activities motivates the members to open individual bank accounts in large numbers.\n\n3.1 Determinants of Repayment Performance of SHGs\nPrompt loan repayment is an imperative factor that determines the financial sustainability of any microfinance initiatives. From the earlier economic performance analysis, it was observed that the repayment of the external bank linkage loans was quite impressive in the study area. However, the prompt repayment of internal loans lacking momentum. Thus, the factors affecting the repayment behaviour of internal group loans have captured through TOBIT censored regression model to identify the determinants of prompt loan repayment by taking the delinquency rate as a dependent variable. The sample mean of the different explanatory variables used in the model is detailed in Table 7. The average delinquency rate was worked out to be 13.28 per cent and varied from zero (complete repayment) to 24.20 per cent in the selected SHGs.\n\n\n\nTable 7: The sample means of different variables used in the Tobit model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nUnit\nMean\nMin\nMax\n\n\n\n\nA) Dependent variable\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelinquency rate\nRatio\n0.1328\n0\n0.2420\n\n\nB) Explanatory variables\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeer monitoring\nNumber\n49.28\n44\n52\n\n\nPeer pressure\nDummy (0/1)\n0.46\n0\n1\n\n\nDegree of Self-selection\nSum of scores\n2.18\n1\n4\n\n\nHomogeneity\nSum of scores\n3.60\n2\n5\n\n\nGroup size\nNumber\n15.16\n11\n20\n\n\nMean dependency ratio\nRatio\n1.84\n1.16\n2.35\n\n\nLoan amount per annum\n1,000 rupees\n43.36\n20\n75\n\n\nAge of SHG\nMonths\n127.65\n40\n228\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proper monitoring mechanism reduces the incidence of wilful default and enhances the group’s ability to collect debt in time. The number of group meetings held per annum was taken as a proxy for capturing the groups’ monitoring ability. Group meetings provide an opportunity to monitor the repayment performance of its members. In general, meetings were convened in members’ homes on a rotation basis. The average number of meetings conducted per annum was found to be 49.28 in the study area and ranged from 44 to 52 meetings per annum.\nThe variable peer pressure was captured through a dummy variable. It was observed that only 37 groups (46.25%) were exerting such kind of pressure on the group members for prompt loan repayment. Further, the self-selected groups have better understandings of their members, and the study assumed that it may lead to prompt loan repayment. The main screening of members occurred in the post group formation period. Therefore, both ex-ante and ex-post factors were considered for measuring the degree of self-selection (Wydick 1999).\nThe intensity of self-selection was captured through the scale developing technique. It was set as a four-digit scale where each positive answer gets one point to assess the intensity of self-selection. The sum of four different indicators—whether groups were formed by voluntary consensus of all the members, whether members were dropped out on group law violations, whether groups explicitly decided to reject new applicants, and whether new members had joined in the post-inception period—were considered for scale development (Verhelle and Berlage 2003; Feroze et al. 2011).\nOut of the total 80 SHGs, 74 groups (92.50%) reported that they formed the group voluntarily without any external agency involvement. The number of groups that rejected the request of a new applicant was found to be 23 (28.75%), and 68 groups (85.00%) added new members even after the inception of the group. Only 9 groups (11.25%) reported member exclusion for violating the decorum of the group. The reasons for exclusion varied from poor attendance in group meetings to non-deposit of weekly savings contributions. The average self-selection score in the selected SHGs was found to be 2.18.\nThe homogeneity in the group was measured by considering different socio-economic characteristics of group members. The scale consists of six indicators: age, religion, education, occupation, landholding size, and marital status. One point was given for each of the following: whether the age range of members was less than 15 years, whether 80% of members belonged to the same religion, had the same marital status, same educational level, same income-earning activity, and similar landholding sizes (Verhelle and Berlage 2003).\nThe highest number of groups (71 SHGs) were homogeneous in marital status (87.5%). A total of 39 groups (48.75%) reported age difference among members within 15 years, and 42 groups (52.50%) reported homogeneity in educational status. About 50 groups (62.5%) reported homogeneity in occupational status, and 63 groups (78.75%) were homogeneous in landholding size. The lowest homogeneity was observed in religion, where only 15 groups (18.75%) were homogeneous. The homogeneity score in the selected groups varied from 2 to 5, with an average of 3.6.\nSmaller groups tend to have better in-group coordination and control, reducing problems from asymmetric information (Ghatak and Guinnane 1999). Thus, it was expected that smaller group size would lead to lower default. The number of members in the selected SHGs ranged from 11 to 20, with an average of 15.16 members.\nThe average number of children directly dependent on the group members was also considered to analyze its role in repayment. The mean dependency ratio was 1.84 and ranged from 1.16 to 2.35 children per member per group.\nGroups fixed a maximum individual loan lending limit based on consensus. A higher loan limit may increase the likelihood of unwilling default. The individual loan limit was used as a proxy for this factor. It varied from Rs.20,000 to Rs.75,000 per member, with an overall average of Rs.43,360.\nThe tenure of group establishment was considered to analyze the role of experience in repayment. Older groups may better understand the repayment capacity of members based on past experience. The average group age was 127 months, ranging from 40 to 228 months in the selected SHGs.\n\n\n3.2 Estimated TOBIT Model\nThe estimated coefficients can alternatively be interpreted as the determinants of prompt loan repayment. From the estimated model (Table 8), it was found that peer pressure, homogeneity of the group, mean dependency ratio, and the amount of loan disbursed were the key factors influencing prompt loan repayment in the study area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nCoefficient\nStd.

This implies that the homogeneity of the groups raises the chance for wilful default. In socially homogeneous groups, individuals strongly rely on the peer’s unconditional support and are thus more likely to ride free, which causes prolonged time for loan repayment.\nAs expected, peer pressure had a negative association with the delinquency rate. The groups that exerted pressure on their members by implementing strict rules and penalties for late repayment demonstrated better repayment performance.\nThe coefficient of the loan amount was found to be positive and significant at the 5 per cent level. The majority of members depended on agriculture and allied activities for their livelihood and followed a ‘balloon repayment schedule’ in the study area. The pronounced seasonality of farming income compelled members to delay timely repayment of internal loans, which were less penalized compared to external bank loans. Similar observations were made by (Khandker, Samad, and Badruddoza 2017) from their Bangladesh-based study on microfinance institutions.\nThe coefficient of dependency ratio was found to be negative and significant in the estimated model. Groups with a higher dependency ratio showed better loan repayment performance, which contradicts earlier expectations.\nEven though the other variables were not statistically significant, they exhibited interesting relationships with the delinquency rate. The coefficient of peer monitoring was negative, indicating that a higher number of meetings per year has a positive influence on prompt loan repayment.\nContrary to prior assumptions, the group size variable turned negative, indicating that larger groups had better repayment rates than smaller groups. The positive coefficient of the degree of self-selection suggests that groups with a high degree of self-selection were more prone to wilful default.\nLastly, the positive coefficient of group establishment tenure indicates that the tendency for delayed repayment was higher among elder groups compared to younger ones. Elder groups were more lenient with their repayment schedules, and many did not impose penalties for irregular payments, which eventually contributed to higher delinquency."

    "text": "Discussion\nThe study provides insights into the financial behaviour of dairy-based SHGs in Kerala, with specific focus on internal loan repayment performance and its determinants. The overall loaning performance showed encouraging trends, particularly with respect to the external bank linkage loans, which recorded a high repayment rate of 99.24 per cent. In contrast, internal loans exhibited relatively lower repayment rates, with an average of 86.72 per cent, highlighting a crucial area for improvement. The Tobit regression analysis identified peer pressure, group homogeneity, dependency ratio, and loan amount as significant predictors of delinquency. Peer pressure had a significant negative relationship with delinquency, reinforcing the notion that groups which enforce rules and repayment discipline are more successful in maintaining financial decorum. Interestingly, homogeneity showed a positive and significant effect on delinquency, which contradicts conventional expectations. This suggests that in highly homogeneous groups, social closeness may undermine financial accountability due to overreliance on peer leniency. A similar counterintuitive result was observed with the dependency ratio, where groups with more dependents showed better repayment rates—possibly due to heightened financial responsibility and urgency among members with larger families.\nThe positive association of loan amount with delinquency reflects the challenges of repayment under seasonal income patterns common in agriculture. Members following balloon repayment schedules were often unable to meet instalments on time, especially in the absence of strong penalties for internal loans. Although other factors like peer monitoring, group size, and selfselection were not statistically significant, their coefficients indicated meaningful directions: more frequent meetings and larger group size were associated with lower delinquency, while greater self-selection surprisingly hinted at more wilful default. Overall, the findings highlight that internal governance, socio-economic dynamics, and institutional design within SHGs substantially influence repayment behaviour. Strengthening peer accountability, revisiting group norms on loan penalties, and promoting financial literacy can enhance the sustainability of internal lending systems within SHGs."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThe present study demonstrates that SHG-based microfinance has the potential to mobilize small savings from poor households while serving as an effective tool for the financial inclusion of women. The saving performance of the groups and the repayment of external bank linkage loans were found to be highly satisfactory in the study area. The integration of dairy activities—known for their ability to provide year-round income—has further supported the members in actively participating in microfinance initiatives. It was observed that a significant portion of group loans was utilized for consumption purposes, particularly for children’s education and medical expenses. Despite this, the repayment performance of external bank loans remained strong, indicating the effective functioning of dairy-based SHGs in rural areas. These groups have played a critical role in enhancing the economic resilience of poor households, especially women, by enabling them to manage their livelihoods more sustainably. Moreover, the experience gained through SHG participation has contributed to improved financial literacy among members. The findings of the study reaffirm the role of SHGs not only as credit providers but also as catalysts for promoting inclusive finance and empowering marginalized communities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcknowledgments\n\n\n\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and the ICAR-National Dairy Research Institute (NDRI), Karnal, for facilitating this research. We also extend our sincere thanks to the participating Self-Help Groups (SHGs) and local functionaries of the Kudumbashree Mission in Kerala for their valuable cooperation and support during the field investigation. The insights and responses shared by the group members were instrumental in shaping the outcomes of this study."

    "section": "1 Introduction",
    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe yardlong bean is one of the most important leguminous vegetables in Asia. Also known as the asparagus bean, string bean, snake bean, or snake pea, it was originally cultivated in West Africa and is now widely grown throughout Southeast Asia—including Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand—where it can be cultivated year-round. In India, it has been known since Vedic times (Benchasri, Bairaman, and Nualsri 2012).\nTypically harvested while still young, the yardlong bean is consumed as a green vegetable. It is an annual plant characterized by rapid growth, especially when supported by a trellis. Both tall and short climbing types exist. A member of the Fabaceae family, the plant features twining, delicate stems with a tenacious root system. It blooms in mid-summer, producing pairs of large white or purple flowers. Once pollinated, these flowers develop into slender, dark green beans that can grow up to 12 inches in just a few days. Mature beans can reach lengths of up to three feet, turning pale green and swelling as the red or black seeds ripen.\nThe yardlong bean also contributes to soil fertility by fixing atmospheric nitrogen through nodules on its roots. It is often referred to as the “poor man’s meat” because its pods are not only rich in protein (23–32% of seed weight) but also contain essential amino acids like lysine and tryptophan, as well as significant levels of folic acid, vitamin B, and other critical micronutrients (Peyrano, Speroni, and Avanza 2016). As such, it serves as a key dietary staple for many of the poorest populations in developing countries.\nDespite its nutritional and agricultural importance, relatively little breeding work has been conducted on this crop. The development of high-yielding, stress-tolerant varieties could significantly boost its cultivation and productivity. However, as a predominantly self-pollinated crop, studies on gene action in yardlong bean remain limited. This study aims to identify gene action governing yield-related traits, which will help inform new breeding strategies to enhance crop improvement efforts."

    "text": "2 Materials and methods\nThe genetic material used in the present study consisted of hybrid (\\(F_1\\)) plants derived from three promising crosses, along with their six respective parents. The selected parental inbred lines were chosen based solely on differences in yield-related traits. Three single-cross \\(F_1\\) hybrids were developed using parents with contrasting characteristics.\nThe three most promising hybrids, based on yield performance and disease resistance from a previous study, were selected for further evaluation. The \\(F_1\\) hybrids were backcrossed to their respective parents to generate backcross (BC) generations. Simultaneously, the \\(F_1\\) hybrids were self-pollinated to produce the corresponding \\(F_2\\) populations.\nGeneration mean analysis was conducted using eighteen populations in total: the three \\(F_1\\)s, their six parents, six backcross generations, and three \\(F_2\\) populations. The experiment was laid out in a randomized block design (RBD) with three replications in the College of Agriculture, Vellayani during Summer 2004. Standard crop management practices were followed throughout the study. Observations on yield and yield-related traits were recorded from 10 plants each for the \\(F_1\\), parent, and backcross generations. For the \\(F_2\\) populations, data were collected from 30 plants per cross.\n\n2.1 Generation Mean Analysis\nThe six-parameter model developed by Hayman (Hayman 1958) was used for generation mean analysis. The four scaling tests (\\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\)) were determined according to the method suggested by Mather (Mather 1949). These different scales are computed using simple linear combinations as given in Equation 1 to Equation 4.\n\\[A = 2\\overline{B_1} - \\overline{F_1} - P_1 = 0 \\tag{1}\\]\n\\[B = 2\\overline{B_2} - \\overline{F_1} - \\overline{P_2} = 0 \\tag{2}\\]\n\\[C = 4\\overline{F_2} - 2\\overline{F_1} - \\overline{P_1} - \\overline{P_2} = 0 \\tag{3}\\]\n\\[D = 4\\overline{F_3} - 2\\overline{F_2} - \\overline{P_1} - \\overline{P_2} = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad D = 2\\overline{F_2} - \\overline{B_2} - \\overline{B_1} \\tag{4}\\]\nWhere \\(P_1\\), \\(P_2\\), \\(F_1\\), \\(F_2\\), \\(B_1\\), and \\(B_2\\) are means of different generations, respectively. The variances of the quantities \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) were calculated from the respective variances of different generations as given from Equation 5 to Equation 8.\n\\[V_A = 4V_{\\overline{B_1}} + V_{\\overline{F_1}} + V_{\\overline{P_1}} \\tag{5}\\]\n\\[V_B = 4V_{\\overline{B_2}} + V_{\\overline{F_1}} + V_{\\overline{P_2}} \\tag{6}\\]\n\\[V_C = 16V_{\\overline{F_2}} + 4V_{\\overline{F_1}} + V_{\\overline{P_1}} + V_{\\overline{P_2}} \\tag{7}\\]\n\\[V_D = 16V_{\\overline{F_3}} + 4V_{\\overline{F_2}} + V_{\\overline{P_1}} + V_{\\overline{P_2}} \\tag{8}\\]\nWhere, \\(V_{P_1}\\) is the variance of the individuals within the \\(P_1\\) family; \\(V_{\\overline{P_1}}\\) is the variance of \\({\\overline{P_1}}\\) (mean of the \\(P_1\\) family); and \\(\\overline{V_{P_1}} = \\frac{V_{P_1}}{N}\\), where \\(N\\) is the number of individuals observed in the \\(P_1\\) family.\nThe standard error of \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) is calculated by taking the square root of their respective variances. The corresponding \\(t\\) values are computed by dividing the values of \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) by their respective standard errors.\nSignificance of any of the four scales indicates the inadequacy of the additive-dominance model and the presence of epistasis. If the calculated \\(t\\) values are found to be significant, the presence of specific types of epistasis is confirmed.\nThe significance of either one or both of the \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) scales indicates the presence of all three types of digenic interaction, namely additive × additive, additive × dominance, and dominance × dominance. The significance of scale \\(C\\) indicates the presence of dominance × dominance type of non-allelic interaction, while the significance of scale \\(D\\) denotes additive × additive type of gene action. When both \\(C\\) and \\(D\\) scales are significant, it suggests the presence of both additive × additive and dominance × dominance types of gene interaction.\n\n\n2.2 Estimation of gene effects\nSignificance of any of the scales \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\) and \\(D\\) will indicate the presence of epistatic interaction or digenic interactions. Hayman and Jinks and Jones gave a 6 parameter model for the estimation of various genetic components. The six genetic parameters were estimated using Equation 9 to Equation 14.\n\\[m = \\overline{F_2} \\tag{9}\\]\n\\[d = \\overline{B_1} - \\overline{B_2} \\tag{10}\\]\n\\[h = \\overline{F_1} - 4\\overline{F_2} - \\frac{\\overline{P_1}}{2}- \\frac{\\overline{P_2}}{2} + 2\\overline{B_1} + 2\\overline{B_2} \\tag{11}\\]\n\\[i = 2\\overline{B_1} + 2\\overline{B_2} - 4\\overline{F_2} \\tag{12}\\]\n\\[j = \\overline{B_1} - \\frac{\\overline{P_1}}{2} - \\overline{B_2} + \\frac{\\overline{P_2}}{2} \\tag{13}\\]\n\\[l = \\overline{P_1} + \\overline{P_2} + 2\\overline{F_1} + 4\\overline{F_2} - 4\\overline{B_1} - 4\\overline{B_2} \\tag{14}\\]\nWhere \\(m\\) = mean; \\(d\\) = additive effect; \\(h\\) = dominance effect; \\(i\\) = additive x additive gene interaction; \\(j\\) = additive x dominance gene interaction; \\(l\\) = dominance x dominance gene interaction.\nThe variances of the six genetic parameters were calculated using Equation 15 to Equation 20\n\\[(m) = V_{\\overline{F_2}} \\tag{15}\\]\n\\[V(d) = V_{\\overline{B_1}} + V_{\\overline{B_2}} \\tag{16}\\]\n\\[V(h) = V_{\\overline{F_1}} + 16V_{\\overline{F_2}} + \\frac{V_{\\overline{P_1}}}{4} + \\frac{V_{\\overline{P_2}}}{4} + 4V_{\\overline{B_1}} + 4V_{\\overline{B_2}} \\tag{17}\\]\n\\[V(i) = 4V_{\\overline{B_1}} + 4V_{\\overline{B_2}} + 16V_{\\overline{F_2}} \\tag{18}\\]\n\\[V(j) = V_{\\overline{B_1}} + \\frac{V_{\\overline{P_1}}}{4} + V_{\\overline{B_2}} + \\frac{V_{\\overline{P_2}}}{4} \\tag{19}\\]\n\\[V(l) = 4V_{\\overline{P_1}} + 4V_{\\overline{P_2}} + 4V_{\\overline{F_1}} + 16V_{\\overline{F_2}} + 16V_{\\overline{B_1}} + 16V_{\\overline{B_2}} \\tag{20}\\]"

    "text": "3 Results\nGeneration mean analysis is a statistical technique used to estimate the components of variance and determine the predominant type of gene action controlling important traits in a crop species. This analysis assists in selecting appropriate breeding strategies for the improvement of various quantitative traits.\nGeneration mean analysis was conducted for three cowpea crosses:\n\nCross 1: VS86 × VS132\n\nCross 2: Kozhicode Local-2 × Thiruvananthapuram Local-12\n\nCross 3: Thiruvananthapuram Local-9 × Thiruvananthapuram Local-12\n\nThe mean values of the six generations (\\(P_1\\), \\(P_2\\), \\(F_1\\), \\(F_2\\), \\(B_1\\), and \\(B_2\\)) for each cross are presented in Table 1. Among them, the \\(F_1\\) of Cross 3 flowered the earliest (38.4 days), while Cross 1 was harvested the earliest (58.1 days). The \\(F_1\\) of Cross 2 exhibited the highest pod yield per plant (454.91 g), whereas the \\(B_2\\) generation of Cross 1 recorded the maximum yield overall (485.67 g).\nThe scale values and genetic component estimates for the various traits across the three crosses are shown in Table 2 and Table 3. The estimated mean effect (\\(m\\)) was highly significant for traits such as days to flowering, pod length, pod breadth, pods per plant, pod yield per plant, and root weight across all crosses, indicating that these traits are quantitatively inherited.\nAs shown in Table 3, significant negative dominant effects (\\(h\\)) were observed for pod length and pod yield per plant, suggesting that these traits are more prominently expressed in homozygous individuals.\n\n\n\nTable 1: Generation mean values of the three crosses in yardlong

    "text": "Discussion\nThe significance of scales \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) for most traits indicates that the simple additive-dominance model is inadequate for explaining their inheritance, as reported by Thakare et al. (2016) and Kudiabor et al. (2023). Non-allelic interactions, alongside additive and dominance components, were observed in the expression of several traits, similar to the findings of Edematie et al. (2021) and Akombo et al. (2021).\nSignificant additive × additive (\\(i\\)) interactions were found for pod length, pods per plant, pod yield per plant, and root weight, suggesting complementary or duplicate epistasis. Non-allelic interactions were also evident in traits like days to first flowering. Here, additive effects were highly significant, and additive × dominance (\\(j\\)) interactions were also observed. Dominance × dominance (\\(l\\)) interactions acted in a favorable negative direction in all hybrids. Similar epistatic interactions for early flowering and duplicate epistasis for traits like days to 90% pod maturity in cowpea were reported by Patel et al. (2013), Thakare et al. (2016), and Owusu et al. (2022).\nThese findings imply that earliness in cowpea could be improved through hybridization followed by the selection of promising recombinants in later generations, particularly in crosses governed by duplicate epistasis.\nThe significance of scales \\(C\\) and \\(D\\) for pod length further supports the involvement of dominance × dominance and additive × additive interactions in this trait. Significant additive (\\(d\\)) and dominance (\\(h\\)) effects for pod length were also reported by Rashwan (2010) and Thakare et al. (2013).\nAmong epistatic interactions, dominance × dominance (\\(l\\)), additive × additive (\\(i\\)), and additive × dominance (\\(j\\)) were observed in different crosses. In the case of pod weight, both dominance effects and additive × additive interactions were significant but acted in a negative direction. However, the positive significance of dominance × dominance interactions suggests that hybridization followed by selection would be an effective strategy for improving this trait.\nAll three types of digenic interactions (\\(i\\), \\(j\\), \\(l\\)) were observed for pods per plant. While additive × dominance (\\(j\\)) was positive and significant, both dominance (\\(h\\)) and additive × additive (\\(i\\)) effects acted in the negative direction. The presence of non-allelic interactions for this trait aligns with the findings of Thakare et al. (2016) and Edematie et al. (2021). Significant positive dominance (\\(h\\)) and dominance × dominance (\\(l\\)) interactions suggest the presence of complementary epistasis. In contrast, the negative significance of dominance × dominance (\\(l\\)) for pod yield per plant implies limited potential for improvement through heterosis breeding for this trait.\nThe direction of dominance and dominance × dominance interactions indicated duplicate gene action in the expression of traits such as pod weight, pod breadth, pods per cluster, seeds per pod, root weight per plant, and days to first harvest. Dominance was found to play a role in all traits, especially pod length, as reported by Santos et al. (2024) and Pallavi, Singh, and Chaudhary (2019).\nBoth additive × additive and dominance × dominance interactions were significant for root weight per plant, while the insignificance of all four scale tests (\\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), \\(D\\)) for traits like pod breadth, pods per cluster, seeds per pod, days to first harvest, primary branches per plant, and 100-seed weight indicates the adequacy of the additive-dominance model for these traits, and the absence of epistasis. Nonetheless, duplicate epistasis for most yield-related traits in cowpea was previously reported by Shinde et al. (2021)."

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nThe generation mean analysis conducted on three cowpea crosses revealed complex genetic control for several important agronomic traits. While the mean effect was highly significant for all key traits, indicating their quantitative nature, the inadequacy of the simple additive-dominance model—evidenced by significant scale tests and the presence of epistasis—highlights the role of non-allelic gene interactions in trait inheritance. Additive × additive, additive × dominance, and dominance × dominance interactions were frequently observed across traits such as pod length, pod yield per plant, pods per plant, and root weight. The predominance of duplicate and complementary epistasis suggests that hybridization followed by selection in segregating generations would be an effective breeding strategy for improving these traits.\nTraits like pod breadth, seeds per pod, and 100-seed weight showed no significant epistasis, indicating that selection based on the additive-dominance model may suffice for their improvement. Conversely, traits influenced by significant non-additive gene actions, such as pod yield and pod weight, may benefit more from recombination breeding approaches. Overall, this study underscores the importance of understanding the underlying gene action for designing appropriate breeding strategies. The insights gained provide a valuable foundation for improving yield and related traits in cowpea through targeted hybridization and selection efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcknowledgments\n\n\n\nThe first author gratefully acknowledges the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Government of India, for awarding the Junior Research Fellowship (JRF) in support of the Ph.D. programme."
