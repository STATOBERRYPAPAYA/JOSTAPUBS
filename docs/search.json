    "section": "1 Introduction",
    "text": "1 Introduction\nAgriculture serves as the foundation of global food systems, supporting human sustenance, economic stability, and environmental sustainability. Its effectiveness largely depends on the decisions and preferences of farmers, consumers, and policymakers. Choices such as selecting resilient crop varieties and inputs, implementing sustainable farming practices, and responding to consumer demand influence productivity and yields while shaping ecological outcomes, biodiversity conservation, and the equitable allocation of resources. Moreover, understanding these preferences enables producers and policymakers to align agricultural outputs with consumer needs, ensuring that market demand is met efficiently and sustainably.Gaining insights into stakeholder preferences is therefore essential for designing effective agricultural policies, promoting technology adoption, and developing marketing strategies (Custodio, Demont, and De Steur 2023; Sawassi et al. 2025).\nOver the years, several preference elicitation and scaling techniques, such as Likert scales, rating, ranking, and pairwise comparison methods, have been widely employed in agricultural and consumer research. Likert and rating scales capture perceived importance or agreement, while ranking methods require respondents to order all items simultaneously, which can become cognitively demanding as the number of attributes increases. Pairwise comparisons simplify the task but still fail to reflect the relative importance among multiple competing attributes. As noted by Parvin (2016), these methods tend to be cognitively more demanding and are susceptible to response and scale-use biases, which can compromise the reliability and comparability of results across respondents.\nBest-Worst Scaling (BWS) is a stated preference method, developed by Jordan J Louviere in 1987, that addresses these limitations by asking respondents to identify both the most and least important items within a choice set. Unlike traditional rating or ranking methods, which require evaluating all items simultaneously, BWS divides the task into smaller, more cognitively manageable parts, simplifying the process and helping respondents make more distinct trade-offs between attributes(Erdem, Rigby, and Wossink 2012). This approach captures the extremes in the inclinations of respondents and reduces the cognitive burden on respondents, making it easier for the surveyor to obtain more accurate and reliable responses with reduced biases (Kiritchenko and Mohammad 2017), (Burton et al. 2021).\nThree main variants of BWS, Case 1 (Object case), Case 2 (Profile case), and Case 3 (Multi-profile case), facilitate identifying preferences according to the context and the nature of items or profiles to be evaluated. Case 1 is the simplest form of BWS, allowing respondents to choose the best and worst items in a list and make a relative ranking of the items Flynn and Marley (2014). Cases 2 and 3 deal with profiles which are combinations of levels of attributes. In the profile case, choices are made within the individual profiles, whereas in the multi-profile case, choices are made between whole profiles (J. J. Louviere, Flynn, and Marley 2015; Cheung et al. 2016).\nWhile previous reviews have examined the methodological evolution and applications of BWS across disciplines (Schuster et al. 2024; Hollin et al. 2022; Beres et al. 2024), most have centred on health and policy domains. Comprehensive analyses focusing specifically on the agricultural sector remain limited. The present review aims to address this gap by systematically examining the use of BWS within agricultural research, highlighting methodological developments, thematic areas, and conceptual contributions. By integrating evidence and perspectives from existing studies, the review presents a coherent narrative on the expanding role of BWS in shaping preference-based research within agriculture."

    "text": "2 Statistical foundations of BWS\nThe Random Utility Theory (RUT) underpins the fundamental principle of BWS Beres et al. (2024), which states that individuals make their choices based on the perceived utility characteristics or the characteristics of a product, which comprises observable attributes and some unobservable random component, as shown in Equation 1.\n\\[\nU_{ij} = V_{ij} + \\varepsilon_{ij}\n\\tag{1}\\]\nwhere Uij is the total utility of the jth item for the ith consumer, Vij denote the utility from the observed characteristics, and εij is the random component. The stochastic component implies that while exact choices cannot be predicted, the probability of each alternative being selected can be estimated statistically Adikari and Diawara (2024).\nIn the context of BWS, this framework can be used to compare the ‘best’ and ‘worst’ choices of an individual.By requiring respondents to identify both extremes of preference within each choice set, BWS captures a fuller range of the utility distribution compared to traditional choice experiments. According to RUT, an item’s relative preference compared to others depends on how frequently it is chosen (J. Louviere et al. 2013). Recent methodological developments have further extended RUT to account for individual-level preference heterogeneity, allowing researchers to better understand differences in choices across respondents (Holmes, Adamowicz, and Carlsson 2017).\nIn agricultural research, RUT and BWS provide a framework for examining how different stakeholders evaluate competing options such as crop varieties, input combinations, market choices, or policy measures, based on perceived benefits and trade-offs. By linking observable attributes like yield, price, sustainability, and quality with individual preferences, BWS enables researchers to quantify the relative importance of these factors, offering valuable insights into agricultural decision-making."

    "section": "3 Experimental Designs in BWS",
    "text": "3 Experimental Designs in BWS\nThe efficiency of a BWS study depends critically on the construction of choice sets in the questionnaire. Asking respondents to rank a large number of items can create cognitive strain and reduce data quality. Parvin (2016) noted out that it is challenging for the respondents to rank more than seven items in a single choice set. To address this, BWS organizes the items into smaller and manageable choice sets, typically containing three to six items each, allowing respondents to make meaningful comparisons without fatigue.\nA statistically efficient design ensures that each item or attribute level appears an equal number of times across all choice sets, and that every possible pair of items co-occurs equally often with similar frequency Lee, Soutar, and Louviere (2008). This balance and orthogonality in the design facilitate the derivation of precise and reliable preference estimates.\nEarly BWS studies used 2J designs Flynn and Marley (2014) to generate choice sets, where J represents the number of items. However, as the number of items increases, the number of possible combinations grows exponentially, making such designs impractical for real-world surveys and burdensome for respondents. To overcome this challenge, recent studies employ Balanced Incomplete Block Design (BIBD) to generate combinations of items in each choice set, as it ensures the balanced occurrence and co-occurrence of objects. This approach is commonly used in the BWS object case (Case 1), where individual items are evaluated directly by respondents, allowing for manageable questionnaires without compromising statistical efficiency.\nIn profile and multi-profile cases, the focus shifts from single items to combinations of attributes that define a product or alternative. Here, the profiles are created using Orthogonal Arrays (OA). If there are K attributes, each with Lk (k = 1, 2, …, K) levels, an LK OA can be used to create profiles while maintaining orthogonality. Each profile is considered as a choice set in BWS case 2, while in Case 3 multiple profiles are combined into choice sets using BIBD. This approach allows researchers to estimate the relative importance of individual attributes and their levels, while keeping the task manageable for respondents (Aizaki and Fogarty 2019; Aizaki 2021)."

    "section": "4 Statistical Models for Analysis",
    "text": "4 Statistical Models for Analysis\nDepending on the complexity of the data and objectives of the research, different analytical models are employed to extract insights from best–worst choices. These models range from simple counting approaches, which provide a basic understanding of preference patterns, to more sophisticated econometric models capable of capturing heterogeneity in preferences.\n\n4.1 Counting approach\nThe counting method, which involves the frequencies of each item being selected as ‘best’ and ‘worst,’ is a simple yet effective approach used to analyse BWS data Burns et al. (2022). The Best-Worst (B-W) score is obtained by subtracting the number of times an item is marked as worst (Wᵢ) from the number of times it is marked as best (Bᵢ), which is then divided by the total number of respondents (n) and the frequency of an item appeared in each choice set (r) to get the standardised score (Equation 2;Equation 3) (Massey et al. 2015; Yin, Kamimura, and Imoto 2023). The Square root B-W score (Equation 4) and Standard B-W score (Equation 5) also represent the preferences Torok et al. (2023).\n\\[B\\!-\\!W\\ Score = B_i - W_i \\tag{2}\\]\n\\[\\text{Standard } B\\!-\\!W\\ \\text{score} = \\frac{B_i - W_i}{r \\times n} \\tag{3}\\]\n\\[\\text{Sqrt. } B\\!-\\!W\\ \\text{score} = \\sqrt{\\frac{B_i}{W_i}} \\tag{4}\\]\n\\[\\text{Standard Sqrt. } B\\!-\\!W\\ \\text{score} = \\frac{\\text{Sqrt. } B\\!-\\!W\\ \\text{score}}{\\max(\\text{Sqrt. } B\\!-\\!W\\ \\text{score})} \\tag{5}\\]\n\n\n4.2 Modelling approaches\nStatistical models grounded in econometric theory and probabilistic frameworks enable rigorous estimation of preference parameters. Modelling approaches provide greater analytical precision and account for response heterogeneity, compared to count-based methods. These models estimate the likelihood of an individual choosing a particular item as ‘best’ or ‘worst’. The probabilistic model represented in Equation 6 forms the theoretical foundation for the statistical models used in the analysis of BWS data. It considers a finite set of alternatives and estimates the probability of selecting an item as best, worst, or jointly as a best–worst pair based on underlying choice processes (A. A. Marley and Louviere 2005).\n\\[\\mathrm{BW}_X(x, y) =\n\\frac{B_X(x)\\, W_X(y)}\n{\\displaystyle \\sum_{\\substack{r,s \\in X \\\\ r \\ne s}} B_X(r)\\, W_X(s)} \\tag{6}\\]\nwhere BX(x) is the probability that the alternative x is chosen as best in X, WX(y) is the probability that the alternative y is chosen as worst in X, and BWX(x, y) is the joint probability of the alternative x is chosen as best in X and the alternative y ≠ x is chosen as worst in X.\nAdvanced models can capture preference heterogeneity across respondents that arises due to geographic, socioeconomic, or behavioural factors. This can be used in agricultural studies to identify the difference in choices of farmers and consumers based on farm size, access to resources, and individual-level factors.\n\n4.2.1 Multinomial Logit Model (MNL)\nMNL is based on the assumption that the preferences of individuals in a population are homogeneous. The joint probability of selecting an item as best and another as worst within a choice set is used to estimate the preference for that item (A. A. J. Marley, Flynn, and Australia 2015). Conceptually, the MNL model represents the probability of choosing a specific best–worst pair based on the relative utilities of the available items in a choice set. This probabilistic framework allows the model to capture the trade-offs respondents make when identifying their most and least preferred items. The resulting estimates provide a population-level measure of preference intensity of each item compared to a reference, making the MNL a fundamental model for advanced analyses of best–worst data (Cheung et al. 2019).\n\n\n4.2.2 Latent Class Analysis (LCA)\nLCA is a cluster analysis method used to uncover the unobserved heterogeneity among respondents when observable characteristics alone cannot form homogeneous groups. Based on this, respondents will be categorised into different latent classes sharing hidden attributes that can affect the selection. The optimal number of clusters is determined by statistical fit criteria such as Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and McFadden’s Pseudo R-squared (ρ²), which are commonly used to assess model performance (Cheung et al. 2019; Barrowclough et al. 2023; Merlino et al. 2025).\n\n\n4.2.3 Hierarchical Bayesian Model (HB)\nHB models capture both within-respondent and across-respondent heterogeneity, producing individual-specific preference estimates (Lagerkvist, Okello, and Karanja 2012; Yeh, Hartmann, and Langen 2020). Lagerkvist, Okello, and Karanja (2012) demonstrated that the HB model outperforms the LCA by capturing both between- and within-respondent preference variation. Its ability to estimate individual-level parameters from limited data makes it particularly useful for analysing best–worst choices.\n\n\n4.2.4 Random Parameter Logit (RPL) or Mixed Logit (MXL) Model\nRPL model provides a more accurate depiction of real-world choice behaviour by allowing for random differences in individual preferences and accounting for correlations among unobserved factors (Viciunaite 2023). It is a generalisation of MNL, used to estimate the individual heterogeneity in preferences. Unlike the MNL, which assumes uniform preferences across respondents, the RPL allows parameters to vary randomly within the population, implying that different people have different preferences. The preference heterogeneity can be estimated by finding the standard deviation of each parameter’s distribution (Cheung et al. 2019).\n\n\n4.2.5 Paired, Marginal, and Marginal Sequential Models for Profile Case\nThree different choice modelling methods, paired, marginal, and marginal sequential models, are used to analyse the responses obtained from a BWS case 2 survey. All models assume that each attribute level provides some utility to the respondent, but differ in how the best and worst levels are determined. The utility of the level chosen as worst is considered the negative of the utility of the level selected as best.\nThe paired model identifies that the chosen best–worst pair represents the largest utility difference among all possible pairs in the set. The marginal model assumes that the best level has the maximum utility and the worst level the minimum utility among all levels, whereas in the marginal sequential model, the best level has the maximum utility among all levels and the worst level the minimum utility among the remaining levels.\nIn all three models, the estimated coefficients indicate the relative preference of respondents for each attribute level, providing insights into the trade-offs made when identifying the most and least important options (Aizaki and Fogarty 2019)."

    "section": "5 Bibliometric Insights into BWS in Agriculture",
    "text": "5 Bibliometric Insights into BWS in Agriculture\nA bibliometric analysis was conducted using the bibliometrix package (Aria and Cuccurullo 2017) in R to examine studies employing BWS to elicit choices in agricultural contexts. The Dimensions database was selected for its broad coverage of multidisciplinary research (Hook, Porter, and Herzog 2018). Publications from 2011 to 2025 were retrieved using the search string: (“Best-Worst Scaling” OR “BWS”) AND (“agriculture” OR “farm” OR “food”). The search was limited to peer-reviewed journal articles and conference papers published in English, ensuring the inclusion of relevant and high-quality academic outputs. Although larger datasets can be obtained from other databases, the export restrictions in these platforms limit their use for the present analysis. The selection of Dimensions thus ensured consistency, transparency, and replicability of the bibliometric workflow.\nAfter screening for relevance and removing duplicates, a total of 75 documents from 54 sources were retained for analysis. The chosen timespan captures both the emergence and evolution of BWS applications in agriculture, beginning with the earliest identifiable studies in 2011. The relatively small corpus reflects the recent adoption of BWS in this field and the method’s growing recognition as a robust alternative to traditional preference elicitation approaches. This also indicates a research gap and an opportunity for further exploration of BWS across diverse agricultural decision-making contexts.\nThese records were analysed to interpret the research trends, current status, thematic distribution, advancements, and interrelationships among studies in this field. The analysis revealed an increasing trend in the scientific production, as shown in Figure 1, with an overall growth rate of 13.65% during the study period. The highest number of publications occurred in 2025, followed by 2020. From 2011 to 2017, the publication activity remained relatively stable and gained acceleration from 2018 onward, indicating a growing interest in BWS-based agricultural studies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Annual scientific production\n\n\n\nA total of 27 countries across the world have engaged in agricultural research employing BWS during this period. Japan (\\(n\\)=15) recorded the highest number of publications, followed by Italy (\\(n\\)=13) and the USA(\\(n\\)=12). Figure 2 illustrates the publication output of all the contributing countries, showing the trends in their research activity. The results indicate that while a few countries, particularly Japan, Italy, the USA, Germany, and the UK, dominate the field, several others are gradually adopting BWS in agricultural studies, reflecting its growing global relevance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Country-wise distribution of publications\n\n\n\nA total of 221 researchers contributed to the 75 examined articles, of which four were single-authored. The average number of authors per article is 3.63. Out of the total, 31 authors have published more than one article. Borra and Massaglia (\\(n\\)=6) are the authors with highest number of publications. Merlino (\\(n\\)=5), Aizaki (\\(n\\)=4), Blanc (\\(n\\)=3), Madureira (\\(n\\)=3), Nunes (\\(n\\)=3), Peano (\\(n\\)=3), Ujiie (\\(n\\)=3), Veiga (\\(n\\)=3), and Yang S (\\(n\\)=3) are the other relevant authors in this field, as given in Figure 3. An international co-authorship of 37.33% was identified, indicating the strong level of cross-country collaboration among the authors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Most relevant authors\n\n\n\nThe reviewed studies were published in 54 journals. The most relevant journals among them were Foods (\\(n\\)= 6), Journal of Dairy Science (\\(n\\)=4), Agricultural Economics (\\(n\\)=3), Food Quality and Preference (\\(n\\)=3), Journal of Environmental Management (\\(n\\)=3), Sustainability (\\(n\\)=3), Agribusiness (\\(n\\)=2), Agriculture (\\(n\\)=2), Australian Journal of Agriculture (\\(n\\)=2), British Food Journal (\\(n\\)=2), and Land Use Policy (\\(n\\)=2).\nThe citations of the articles were analysed and found that, on an average, each article had 19.8 citations, with an average of 3.11 citations per document per year. Eight studies had more than fifty citations, with (Dekhili, Sirieix, and Cohen 2011) recording the highest (140), followed by (Dumbrell, Kragt, and Gibson 2016) with 109 and (Massaglia et al. 2019) with 101. The citation network (Figure 4) revealed the interrelations among influential studies, highlighting the focal role of (Dekhili, Sirieix, and Cohen 2011) in connecting multiple research clusters within the field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Network visualization of citations\n\n\n\nThe bibliometric findings reveal a steady growth in the use of BWS within agricultural research over the past fifteen years. The method’s expanding adoption across countries and journals reflects its growing credibility as a reliable approach for capturing stakeholder preferences and supporting evidence-based decision-making. Although the number of retrieved publications is modest, this primarily reflects database-specific constraints and the relatively recent integration of BWS into agricultural research workflows. The observed trends highlight the increasing recognition of BWS as a valuable tool for understanding preferences in agricultural decision-making, signifying its potential for broader application in future agricultural studies."

    "text": "6 Applications of BWS in Agricultural Research\nThe application of BWS in the agricultural sector has increased significantly over the years. The bibliometric analysis substantiates that there is a growing trend in its application from 2011 to 2025. The involvement of smaller choice sets and the ability to capture nuanced distinctions in preferences made BWS a more preferred method of choice evaluation over the traditional rating and ranking methods. This section examines the major studies that have employed BWS to understand the preferences of agricultural stakeholders.\nThe reviewed body of literature demonstrates that BWS has been applied across a broad spectrum of agricultural contexts, encompassing consumer behaviour, farm management, sustainability practices, policy evaluation, and genetic improvement. Table 1 presents an overview of the reviewed studies, summarising the types of BWS and the analytical methods used in different research contexts. It illustrates the wide range of agricultural and allied topics where BWS has been applied, with the three cases of BWS being applied to address distinct study objectives.\nAmong the reviewed literature, BWS Case 1 is the dominant one, featuring in the majority of publications. Research by (Baviera-Puig et al. 2025), (Uliano and Lerro 2025), (Wardyani et al. 2025), (Cammarelle et al. 2024), (Torok et al. 2023), (Aizaki and Takeshita 2023), (Giuggioli et al. 2023), (Chrysochou et al. 2022), (Sarma 2020), (Massaglia et al. 2019), (Bazzani et al. 2016), and (Dekhili, Sirieix, and Cohen 2011) used Case 1 to identify the preference patterns of consumers in the purchase of different agricultural products. It has also been employed to capture the choice behaviour of farmers regarding the selection of farm inputs as given in (Ahoudou et al. 2023), (Burns et al. 2022), (Maruyama et al. 2022), and (Aizaki et al. 2016). The studies by (Merlino et al. 2025), (Liu et al. 2025), (Zander et al. 2024), (Aizaki, Akahori, and Yamamoto 2025), (Chang et al. 2022), (Bhatta, Zander, and Garnett 2022), (Caputo and Lusk 2020), (Jackson et al. 2020), (Dumbrell, Kragt, and Gibson 2016), and (Cross, Rigby, and Edwards-Jones 2012) adopted BWS to analyse different agricultural technologies, practices, and policies. Additionally, (Ibe et al. 2024) and (Burns et al. 2022) applied BWS to support genetic breeding activities, while (Atta and Micheels 2020) identified the risks in agricultural production through an object case study.\nBWS Cases 2 and 3 appeared in fewer studies which evaluated different attributes or profiles. These studies explored themes such as consumer choices (Aizaki and Sato 2020; Ola and Menapace 2020; Mizuki and Yasue 2025; Rolfe et al. 2023), production strategies (Sackett, Shupp, and Tonsor 2013; Chelang’a et al. 2025; Shittu et al. 2021), and agricultural policies (Guo and Shen 2020).\nAcross the reviewed studies, the analysis of the data is widely done through count-based methods as well as advanced modelling methods, including MNL, LCA, HB, and RPL, to capture different patterns of preference heterogeneity among respondents. Many of the researchers have applied LCA to identify the latent characteristics that can influence decision-making.\nCollectively, these applications underscore the practical value of BWS in guiding agricultural innovation, marketing, and policymaking. By quantifying what stakeholders value most and least, BWS contributes to evidence-based strategies that align agricultural development with stakeholder priorities. Beyond identifying preferences, BWS has provided actionable insights that have informed marketing strategies, guided policy priorities, and shaped technology adoption frameworks. The studies applying BWS to consumer choice contexts have refined the design and marketing of agri-food products, while farmer-oriented studies have supported evidence-based input subsidy and risk management programs. Policy-oriented research has aided in prioritising sustainability measures and resource allocation in line with stakeholder values. Overall, the methodological rigour and interpretive strength of BWS have enabled a deeper understanding of stakeholder preferences and their translation into practically relevant interventions. The growing body of evidence positions BWS as a bridge between preference research and real-world agricultural policymaking.\n\n\n\nTable 1: Summary of agricultural studies employing

    "text": "7 Conclusion\nThe application of BWS in agricultural research has been increasing rapidly in recent years, as confirmed by the bibliometric analysis, with the object case (Case 1) emerging as the most commonly employed. BWS proves to be a significant tool in the field of agriculture for understanding farmer preferences and consumer choices. By capturing the most and least preferred items, it enables the relative ranking of attributes. This knowledge helps the researchers to prioritise the traits for product development and trend prediction, enabling policymakers to use the interpretations obtained from BWS to frame policies.\nThe review underscores that the three cases of BWS facilitate more precise measurement of preferences in different contexts of agricultural studies, such as environmental sustainability, productivity, and cost-related trade-offs. By providing a robust statistical foundation, BWS supports more informed policy formulation and management decisions. It effectively addresses the limitations of traditional preference measurement techniques and offers a comprehensive understanding of stakeholder choices through the adoption of advanced modelling approaches. Consequently, BWS enables more targeted and effective interventions in the field of agriculture.\nCareful experimental design, precise statistical analysis, and thoughtful interpretation of results will open up new avenues for applying BWS in agricultural research. Future research should focus on developing more efficient experimental designs that better capture heterogeneity in responses. As noted by (Gopinath et al. 2021), developing robust, open-source web applications with intuitive, interactive interfaces can make agricultural data analysis more accessible for researchers. Such platforms and software tools can promote wider adoption of BWS in the agricultural sector, from on-farm management to policy making."

    "section": "1 Introduction",
    "text": "1 Introduction\nSurvey research is a widely used method for collecting quantitative data on human behaviour, attitudes, and opinions. The accuracy of insights derived from surveys largely depends on the quality of the instruments used, particularly the validity and reliability of questionnaires (Carmines and Zeller 1979; Cronbach 1951). Validity ensures that a questionnaire measures the intended construct, while reliability indicates the consistency of measurements over time.\nHowever, assessing these psychometric properties can be challenging, as traditional methods often involve manual calculations or specialised statistical software that may not be readily accessible to all researchers (Pallant 2020). To address this limitation, a user-friendly web application was developed to automate validity and reliability testing, providing real-time feedback through an intuitive interface (Kline 2023) This innovation enables researchers to perform comprehensive psychometric evaluations efficiently, regardless of their statistical expertise.\nIn applied research contexts such as agriculture, questionnaires are among the most commonly used tools, yet many studies fail to report procedures for assessing validity (31%) and reliability (33%) (Radhakrishna 2007). By automating these assessments, the developed web application reduces measurement errors-such as sampling, selection, and frame errors-thereby improving the precision and consistency of data collection (Singh 2017).\nOverall, the web application enhances the methodological rigour of survey research by simplifying complex statistical evaluations, empowering researchers to design reliable and valid instruments, and strengthening the credibility of research outcomes. Its adoption can significantly improve research quality, particularly in developing regions where expertise in psychometric analysis is often limited."

    "section": "2 Methodology",
    "text": "2 Methodology\n\n2.1 Reliability\nReliability ensures the consistency and stability of a measurement tool, producing similar results under identical conditions (Nunnally and Bernstein 1994). It underpins the credibility of research by confirming that findings reflect true phenomena rather than measurement errors. Figure 1 categorises reliability into four types: Test-retest, Parallel-form, Interrater, and Internal consistency. Each type includes specific methods such as Pearson Correlation, ICC, Cohen’s Kappa, and Cronbach’s Alpha for assessing consistency. They ensure measurement stability, agreement, and internal accuracy across tests and raters.\nAssessing reliability often requires complex statistical calculations and multiple software tools, making it challenging for researchers without strong statistical expertise. Interpreting results like ICC, Cronbach’s Alpha, or Cohen’s Kappa can also be confusing and time-consuming. To overcome these difficulties, this web application was developed to provide an integrated, user-friendly platform that automates reliability testing and simplifies result interpretation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Types of reliability and statistical tests used to assess reliability\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Validity\nValidity testing ensures that research instruments accurately measure the intended constructs, enhancing the credibility and quality of findings (Cronbach and Meehl 1955). It minimises measurement errors, strengthens reliability, and supports the generalization of results to broader contexts. Using valid tools ensures ethical responsibility, as accurate data lead to meaningful scientific contributions and sound decision-making in applied fields. Validity testing also refines instruments by confirming that each item measures only its intended construct, thereby advancing reliable and theory-based research.\nFigure 2 classifies validity into Content, Construct, Criterion, and Face Validity. Each type uses specific methods like EFA, CFA, Correlation Analysis, and Expert Review to ensure instruments measure intended constructs accurately. Together, these tests strengthen measurement accuracy, relevance, and scientific credibility.\nTesting validity involves complex statistical methods like EFA, CFA, and correlation analyses, which require advanced statistical knowledge and multiple software tools. Interpreting these results can be time-consuming and confusing for non-experts. To overcome these challenges, this web application was developed to integrate all validity tests into one user-friendly platform, automating analysis and simplifying result interpretation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Types of validity and statistical tests to assess validity\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3 Framework selection\nThe Shiny was the natural choice for building this application-combining the analytical muscle of R with the sleek interactivity of modern web design (Chang et al. 2023). For researchers diving deep into survey validity and reliability, Shiny offers a powerful toolkit: real-time responsiveness, seamless integration with R’s rich statistical libraries, and effortless web deployment (Beeley 2018). But what truly sets it apart is its flexibility. Whether a seasoned data scientist or a curious newcomer, Shiny makes complex analyses accessible and intuitive (R Core Team 2020). By tailoring the interface to the unique needs of survey-based research, the platform doesn’t just crunch numbers-it tells a story, empowers exploration, and invites insight (Xie, Allaire, and Grolemund 2018).\n\n\n2.4 Application Architecture\n\nUser interface (UI)\nThe user interface of the Shiny app was meticulously designed to strike a balance between simplicity and functionality, ensuring that users can navigate the application with ease while accessing powerful analytical tools. The UI is structured into several key sections, as shown in Figure 3.\n\nNavigation Sidebar\nThe sidebar serves as the central hub for navigation, providing users with quick access to all the main functions of the app. This includes uploading data files, selecting statistical tests, and accessing help documentation. The sidebar’s organised layout ensures that users can find what they need without unnecessary clutter, enhancing the overall user experience.\n\n\nData Upload Mechanism\nA robust data upload mechanism is a crucial feature of the UI. Users are guided to upload their survey data in CSV format, which the app immediately processes. The application is designed to perform an initial check on the uploaded data, identifying any potential issues such as missing values or formatting errors. This immediate feedback loop allows users to correct problems before they begin their analyses, thereby streamlining the workflow (R Core Team 2020).\n\n\nTest Selection Interface\nThe app offers a dropdown menu that categorizes the available tests under broader sections such as “Reliability” and “Validity.” Within these categories, users can further select specific tests like Cronbach’s Alpha, Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), or Factor Analysis. The structured organization of the test selection process ensures that users can easily find and apply the appropriate tests to their data, regardless of their statistical expertise.\n\n\nDynamic Result Display\nThe results generated by the selected tests are presented in a dynamic and interactive format within the main panel of the UI. Depending on the nature of the test, results may be displayed as tables, graphs, or textual summaries. The UI also provides options for users to download or export these results in various formats, facilitating further analysis or inclusion in research reports. This feature ensures that the application not only performs the necessary calculations but also presents the findings in a clear and usable format (Chang et al. 2023).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: User interface of the developed app\n\n\n\n\n\n\nServer-side logic\nThe server component of the Shiny app is where the real power of the application lies. It is responsible for processing the uploaded data and executing the complex statistical analyses required for testing validity and reliability. The server’s architecture follows a systematic workflow:\n\nData Preprocessing\nOnce a user uploads their data, the server immediately reads the CSV file into R and conducts a series of preprocessing steps. These include checking for missing data, validating data types, and ensuring that the dataset meets the prerequisites for the selected tests. Such preprocessing safeguards data quality and reduces the likelihood of analytical errors, If any issues are identified, the server communicates these back to the user through the UI, guiding corrections.\n\n\nExecution of Statistical Tests\nThe core functionality of the server revolves around performing statistical tests. For reliability testing, this includes calculations for metrics like Cronbach’s Alpha, ICC, and Cohen’s Kappa (Cronbach 1951; Shrout 1998; Fleiss 1971; Cohen 1992). For validity, the server can compute measures such as the Content Validity Ratio (Lawshe 1975) and conduct Factor Analysis. The server is optimised for efficiency, ensuring results are produced quickly, even for large datasets.\n\n\nReactive Programming\nOne of Shiny’s key strengths is its reactive programming model, which the server leverages fully. This model ensures that any changes made by the user-such as selecting different tests, uploading new datasets, or modifying parameters-trigger immediate updates in the displayed results (Chang et al. 2023). This interactivity is essential for fostering an intuitive user experience and enabling researchers to explore different analyses in real time.\n\n\n\nData flow within the application\nThe data flow within the Shiny app is designed to be seamless and efficient, guiding users through the process from data upload to result interpretation in a logical sequence. Figure 4 explains the following steps of the data flow within the application.\n\nFile Upload\nUsers begin by uploading their survey data in a CSV format. The app’s UI facilitates this process, ensuring that users can easily locate and upload their files.\n\n\nData Validation\nUpon upload, the server automatically validates the data, checking for common issues such as missing values, incorrect data types, or formatting errors. This step is crucial for ensuring that the dataset is ready for analysis.\n\n\nTest Selection\nOnce the data is validated, users can select the desired statistical tests from the dropdown menu. The app’s organization of tests under broader categories like “Reliability” and “Validity” makes this process straightforward.\n\n\nData Analysis\nThe server processes the validated data and performs the selected statistical tests. Thanks to R’s powerful statistical packages (Beeley 2018), the app can handle a wide range of analyses, from simple metrics like Cronbach’s Alpha to more complex procedures like Factor Analysis.\n\n\nResult Presentation\nAfter the analysis is complete, the results are dynamically displayed in the UI. Users can interact with these results, explore different aspects of the data, and even download the findings for further examination or reporting.\nThis well-orchestrated data flow ensures that users can efficiently conduct their analyses, moving smoothly from one step to the next without unnecessary delays or complications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Data flow within the application"

    "section": "4 User Gratification Test",
    "text": "4 User Gratification Test\nTo evaluate the developed web application, user gratification was employed as the primary testing construct. User gratification, drawn from psychology and consumer behaviour theories, reflects the satisfaction users experience when interacting with a system (Ruggiero 2000). It provides a holistic framework that incorporates both functional and hedonic dimensions of user experience.\nFor academic research platforms, gratification is shaped by factors such as ease of use (Davis 1989), trust in results (Gefen, Rigdon, and Straub 2011), aesthetic appeal (Blythe and Hassenzahl 2003), and the extent to which the system meets user requirements. Accordingly, the application was tested across these dimensions to determine its effectiveness in supporting research activities.\nA total of 30 participants were selected using convenience sampling, comprising postgraduate students and researchers in agricultural sciences. User gratification was measured using a 5-point Likert scale (1 = Strongly Disagree to 5 = Strongly Agree). The constructs included Technology (2 items), Hedonic (2 items), Risk (2 items), and Behavioural Intention (1 item).\nThe functional aspects of gratification were assessed by examining accuracy, efficiency, and automation in validity and reliability testing. These features reduce manual effort and save time, directly contributing to user satisfaction. The hedonic aspects, including enjoyment, interactivity, and engagement (Venkatesh and Bala 2008), were also measured, recognising their role in transforming data analysis into a more engaging process.\nSpecific indicators such as convenience, authenticity of results, user engagement, privacy concerns, and behavioural intentions were incorporated into the evaluation. This ensured that both the technical performance and psychological impact of the system were captured. By adopting user gratification as a testing framework, the study provides insights into how well the application fulfils user expectations and promotes its continued use in academic research."

    "text": "5 Results\n\n5.1 Results of the Developed Web Application\nThe developed web application demonstrated effectiveness in automating the assessment of validity and reliability for survey instruments. The platform provided real-time feedback through an intuitive interface, eliminating the need for manual computation or advanced statistical software. Application of the tool reduced measurement errors and ensured more accurate data collection. In agricultural research and related fields, the web application enabled systematic reporting of psychometric properties, addressing the prevalent issue of omitted validity and reliability procedures. Overall, the tool enhanced methodological rigour and improved the credibility of research findings, particularly in contexts with limited statistical expertise and resources. Figure 6 shows the Result of the Developed Web Application.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Result of the developed web application\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Reliability Test\nThe reliability of the user gratification construct was evaluated using Cronbach’s Alpha. Table 1 presents the results for the four key dimensions: technology (convenience), hedonic (enjoyment), risk (privacy concern), and behavioural intention.\nAll four dimensions demonstrated strong internal consistency. Technology (convenience) showed good reliability (α = 0.80), while hedonic (enjoyment) also indicated good reliability (α = 0.89). Risk (privacy concern) achieved the highest reliability (α = 0.97), reflecting excellent consistency. Behavioral intention was similarly reliable (α = 0.91).

Factor loadings are presented in Table 2. Items with loadings above 0.60 were retained as acceptable indicators of their respective factors.\nThe results indicate strong item loadings across most constructs, with the majority exceeding the recommended threshold of 0.70, confirming convergent validity. The Technology (Authenticity of Conversation) factor showed particularly high loadings (α &gt; 0.81 to 0.92), reflecting the natural and human-like interaction experience provided by the chatbot. Hedonic (Enjoyment) and Hedonic (Pass Time) dimensions also demonstrated high loadings (ranging from 0.76 to 0.91), highlighting the engaging and enjoyable aspects of the application.\nRisk-related factors were also significant. Privacy Concerns had high loadings (0.85–0.93), showing that users remain cautious about data security. Similarly, Immature Technology loadings (0.84–0.95) suggested some limitations in system accuracy and responsiveness. Behavioral intention showed relatively lower loadings (0.58–0.75), but still indicated a positive tendency toward future use and recommendation of the chatbot.\nThese findings confirm that the web application provides gratification both functionally (convenience, authenticity) and hedonically (enjoyment, pass time), while also highlighting areas of concern regarding privacy and system maturity.\n\n\n\nTable 2: Factor loadings for user gratification dimensions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFactors\nLoading\n\n\n\n\nTechnology (Convenience)\n\n\n\nThe web application makes accessing validity and reliability tests easier.\n0.81\n\n\nThe interface of the web application is user-friendly.\n0.74\n\n\nTechnology (Authenticity of Results)\n\n\n\nThe web application provides accurate reliability and validity test results.\n0.81\n\n\nThe results from the web application are as reliable as results from other software like SPSS or Mplus.\n0.86\n\n\nI trust the web application’s accuracy in delivering precise analysis for my survey data.\n0.92\n\n\nHedonic (Enjoyment)\n\n\n\nI find using the web application for conducting survey research tests enjoyable.\n0.81\n\n\nUsing the web application adds an element of interest to analyzing survey data.\n0.92\n\n\nThe interactive features of the web application allow me to conduct validity and reliability tests anytime and anywhere using the developed web application.\n0.78\n\n\nHedonic (Pass Time)\n\n\n\nUtilizing the web application is a productive way to spend time on improving survey research quality.\n0.84\n\n\nRunning tests on the web application helps alleviate the stress of manual calculations.\n0.88\n\n\nI enjoy exploring the web application to enhance my survey research in my free time.\n0.83\n\n\nRisk (Privacy Concerns)\n\n\n\nI am concerned about the privacy of my survey data when using the web application.\n0.91\n\n\nI feel that the web application might collect too much sensitive information.\n0.93\n\n\nUsing the web application makes me concerned about the security of my uploaded data.\n0.85\n\n\nRisk (Immature Technology)\n\n\n\nThe web application sometimes fails to perform all the intended validity and reliability tests.\n0.95\n\n\nThe interface of the web application occasionally crashes or produces vague results.\n0.88\n\n\nI find that the web application struggles to handle large or complex datasets.\n0.84\n\n\nBehaviour Intention\n\n\n\nI will recommend others to use this web application for testing the reliability and validity of their survey data.\n0.58\n\n\nI intend to use the web application for all my future survey research tests.\n0.69\n\n\nI plan to explore more web-based tools and applications like this one for survey data analysis.\n0.75\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Regression Analysis\nA multiple regression analysis was conducted to examine the influence of six predictors: Technology Convenience, Technology Authenticity, Hedonic Enjoyment, Hedonic Pass Time, Risk Privacy, and Risk Immature Technology-on Behavioural Intention.\nThe regression model was statistically significant, F(6,24) = 8.07, p &lt; 0.001, indicating that the predictors collectively explained a substantial portion of the variance in Behavioural Intention. The model accounted for 66.9% of the variance (R² = 0.669; Adjusted R² = 0.586). Among the predictors, Technology Authenticity (β = 0.641, p = 0.015) and Hedonic Pass Time (β = 0.421, p = 0.024) had significant positive effects on Behavioural Intention. This suggests that participants who perceived the web application as authentic and those who used it as a meaningful way to pass time were more likely to express stronger behavioural intention to use it. Technology Convenience (β = 0.256, p = 0.082) showed a positive but only marginally significant effect (p &lt; 0.10). Hedonic Enjoyment (β = 0.273, p = 0.412), Risk Privacy (β = 0.031, p = 0.632), and Risk Immature Technology (β = -0.066, p = 0.365) were not significant predictors of Behavioural Intention.

    "section": "1 Introduction",
    "text": "1 Introduction\nStatistical analysis serves as the backbone of scientific research, especially in disciplines like agriculture, where field experiments, survey data, and observational studies generate complex datasets. Despite the increasing emphasis on data-driven decision-making in agricultural research, many students, early-career researchers, and practitioners find themselves at a disadvantage when it comes to performing rigorous statistical analyses. The process is often hindered by a combination of factors: the steep learning curve associated with programming languages such as R and Python, the fragmented nature of statistical learning resources, and the lack of user-friendly tools tailored to agricultural research contexts.\nWhile R and Python are powerful, flexible, and widely adopted in academic and professional settings, their command-line interfaces and syntax-heavy operations can be challenging for those without formal training in statistics or computer programming. Beginners frequently struggle with package selection, data cleaning, model specification, and interpretation of results. Furthermore, existing statistical software either lacks the flexibility and transparency of open-source tools or comes with licensing restrictions and high costs that limit accessibility in resource-constrained settings, particularly in developing countries.\nIn addition, agricultural research involves domain-specific needs such as handling experimental designs (e.g., CRD, RBD, split-plot), analyzing agronomic trials, processing survey data with appropriate sampling designs, and interpreting interactions between multiple environmental and genetic factors. Traditional statistical packages are not always well-adapted to these specific requirements, leaving researchers to either customize solutions on their own or consult specialists — both of which can delay or compromise the analytical workflow.\nTo bridge this gap, we developed RAISINS (R and AI Solutions for INferential Statistics) — a web-based platform designed to simplify and democratize statistical analysis for agricultural research. RAISINS integrates the power of R, Python, and AI-driven assistance within an intuitive interface that eliminates the need for code-based interaction. By abstracting complex syntax and offering guided, step-by-step workflows for data upload, analysis, visualization, and interpretation, the platform empowers users to focus on scientific inquiry rather than technical execution.\nBuilt on open-source technologies and scalable cloud infrastructure, RAISINS provides modules for commonly used statistical methods — including descriptive analysis, hypothesis testing, regression models, design of experiments, multi environmental trials, and more — while incorporating AI tools that assist in data summarization, analytical suggestions, and natural language explanations of results. This makes it an ideal solution for students, researchers, extension personnel, and educators engaged in agricultural and allied sciences. RAISINS can be accessed online through its official web portal at https://www.raisins.live/.\nIn this paper, we present the design, features, and use-cases of RAISINS, and demonstrate how it addresses the unique challenges faced in agricultural data analysis by offering an accessible, robust, and intelligent statistical platform."

    "text": "2 Materials and methods\n\n2.1 Platform architecture and module validation\nRAISINS is a modular cloud-hosted, web-based platform that integrates statistical computing, artificial intelligence, and modern pedagogical design to serve agricultural researchers and students. Built using R, Python, and OpenAI APIs, RAISINS is deployed via Posit Connect Cloud (https://connect.posit.cloud/), enabling browser-based access without requiring any local software installation. The RAISINS platform is modular and each statistical tool within is aligned with the theoretical underpinnings found in globally recognized academic literature.\nAll modules in RAISINS have been peer-reviewed by domain experts, including statisticians specializing in design of experiments, genetics, and social science research. This ensures both methodological rigor and instructional clarity.\nTable 1 presents the major analytical domains addressed by RAISINS, the foundational academic references supporting each module domain, organized by area of application.\n\n\n\nTable 1: Foundational literature supporting each RAISINS module domain, organized by area of application.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModule Domain\nTheoretical Foundation\n\n\n\n\nDesign & Analysis of Experiments\nMontgomery (2017) (Montgomery 2017); Gomez & Gomez (1984) (Gomez and Gomez 1984); Das & Giri (2018) (Das and Giri 2018); Searle (1997) (Searle 1997); Dey (1986) (Dey 1986); Cox & Reid (2000) (Cox and Reid 2000); Toutenburg & Shalabh (2009) (Toutenburg and Shalabh 2009); Cochran & Cox (1957) (Cochran and Cox 1957); ; Federer (1985) (Federer 1985)\n\n\nStatistical Genetics\nFalconer & Mackay (1996) (Falconer and Mackay 1996); Lynch & Walsh (1998) (Lynch and Walsh 1998); Dabholkar (1999) (Dabholkar 1999); Gillespie (2004) (Gillespie 2004)\n\n\nSocial Science Research\nBabbie (2020) (Babbie 2020); Bryman (2016) (Bryman 2016); Bhattacherjee (2012) (Bhattacherjee 2012)\n\n\nStatistical Inference and Modeling\nCasella & Berger (2002) (Casella and Berger 2002); Hogg, McKean & Craig (2018) (Hogg, McKean, and Craig 2018); Agresti (2013) (Agresti 2013); Rao (2009) (Rao 2009); Rohatgi (1984) (Rohatgi 1984)\n\n\nData Visualization & Reporting\nTufte (2001) (Tufte 2001); Cleveland (1993) (Cleveland 1993); Few (2009) (Few 2009)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe algorithms and workflows integrated into RAISINS are grounded in established statistical theory, drawing extensively from authoritative texts and peer-reviewed literature. In cases where existing computational implementations were unavailable or insufficient, original algorithms were developed in adherence to rigorous theoretical principles. The platform’s design and interface have been iteratively refined based on user-centered feedback from researchers and educators, ensuring methodological soundness and usability consistent with global standards in scientific research and statistical education.\n\n\n2.2 Packages and Libraries\nRAISINS integrates a comprehensive ecosystem of open-source R and Python packages to deliver its core functionalities, encompassing statistical modeling, data visualization, artificial intelligence, and interactive web-based deployment. These packages support the platform’s goal of offering high-level statistical capabilities through an accessible and intuitive interface, particularly beneficial for students and researchers in agricultural sciences.\nThe R-based architecture of RAISINS is built around the shiny framework (Chang et al. 2024), which enables the development of dynamic, browser-accessible applications. Data manipulation tasks are performed using dplyr (Wickham et al. 2024), tidyr, and data.table, while data visualization is implemented through ggplot2 (Wickham 2023), along with complementary packages such as ggthemes, plotly (Sievert 2023), and ggpattern. For statistical analysis relevant to agricultural experiments and general inference, the platform employs packages including agricolae (Mendiburu 2020), broom (Robinson and Hayes 2024), effectsize, lsr, car, phia, and FactoMineR (Husson et al. 2020). These libraries provide robust support for model fitting, hypothesis testing, effect size estimation, and multivariate analysis.\nTo enhance user interaction and responsiveness, RAISINS integrates several user interface and usability packages, such as shinyWidgets, shinyalert, shinybusy, shinycustomloader, shinyBS, shinythemes, and colourpicker. The presentation and export of analytical results are managed through tools like rmarkdown, kableExtra, and formattable, ensuring professional and structured output for reports and publications.\nThe reticulate(Allaire et al. 2024) package serves as a bridge between R and Python, allowing both languages to be used seamlessly within the same analytical workflow. In RAISINS, reticulate enables the platform to call Python functions, use Python libraries, and exchange data objects between R and Python environments. This integration allows the platform to combine R’s interactive capabilities with Python’s strengths in machine learning, statistical modeling, and AI-driven tasks, thereby enhancing both flexibility and functionality.\nPython libraries are used to extend the platform’s analytical and AI-driven features. Packages such as pandas (The pandas development team 2024) and numpy (Harris et al. 2020) are employed for efficient data handling, while matplotlib and seaborn support graphical representations. For machine learning and statistical modeling, the platform uses scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al. 2011) and statsmodels (Seabold and Perktold 2010). The openai package enables the integration of language models, facilitating intelligent assistance and automated content generation within the platform.\nAll R and Python packages used in RAISINS are well-maintained, community-supported, and widely recognized within academic and applied data science contexts. Each library is carefully selected based on its performance, stability, and relevance to agricultural research workflows. Modules are thoroughly reviewed by subject-matter experts to ensure methodological accuracy and pedagogical effectiveness, thereby maintaining the platform’s commitment to reproducibility, transparency, and educational value."

    "text": "1 Introduction\nSesame (Sesamum indicum L., 2n=2x=26) represents one of humanity’s most ancient cultivated oilseed crops, with archaeological evidence suggesting its cultivation dates back over 4,000 years (Bedigian 2015). Known by various vernacular names including Gingelly, Ellu in Malayalam, and Tila in Sanskrit, this crop holds profound cultural and religious significance, particularly in Indian traditions where sesame seeds feature prominently in Hindu religious ceremonies (Wei et al. 2015). The ancient Sanskrit etymology supports the hypothesis that sesame may have been the source of the first extracted vegetable oil, underlining its historical importance in human nutrition (Pathak et al. 2014). Modern nutritional analysis reveals that sesame seeds contain 50–60% oil of exceptional quality, comparable to olive oil in its nutritional profile (Uzun, Yol, and Furat 2008; Anilakumar et al. 2010).\nSesame oil demonstrates remarkable stability compared to other edible oils, primarily attributed to its rich content of natural antioxidants including sesamin, sesaminol, sesamol, sesamolinol, and squalene (Namiki 2007; Kamal-Eldin, Moazzami, and Washi 2011). The oil’s high concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids, combined with its cholesterol-lowering and blood pressure-reducing properties, has renewed scientific and commercial interest in this ancient crop (Sankar et al. 2006; Gouveia et al. 2014; Dalibalta, Majdalawieh, and Manjikian 2020).\nRecent genomic studies have revealed the complex genetic architecture underlying sesame’s agronomic traits, with high-throughput sequencing technologies enabling the identification of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with yield components and stress tolerance (Zhang et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2016; Yu et al. 2019). These advances have opened new avenues for marker-assisted selection and genomic breeding approaches (Wei et al. 2016; Dossa et al. 2017).\nDespite its nutritional superiority and agricultural advantages—including drought tolerance, low input requirements, and suitability for crop rotations due to its extensive taproot system (Ashri 2007)—sesame productivity remains disappointingly low. India, while leading globally in both cultivation area (1.8 million hectares) and production (0.87 million tonnes), achieves an average productivity of only 483 kg/ha, significantly below China (1,200 kg/ha) and Turkey (1,100 kg/ha) (FAO 2020; Yahaya et al. 2021)."

Days to flowering ranged from 18.73 days (KYM-1) to 34.8 days (Tilarani) with a mean of 27.35 days. Plant height showed extensive variation from 31.40 cm (IVTS-06-12) to 107.97 cm (Soma), averaging 53.44 cm. Seed yield per plant, the most variable trait, ranged from 1.35g (IVTS-06-22) to 7.02g (SVPR-1) with a mean of 3.47g.\nThe genetic parameters for the traits studied as a part of the experiment are presented in Table 3.\nNumber of branches per plant (51.83%) and capsules per plant (43.56%) show the highest variability, indicating excellent prospects for selection and breeding. Low variability in 1000-seed weight (2.95%) suggests this trait is more genetically stable across genotypes.\nAll traits exhibited high broad-sense heritability exceeding 85%. The highest heritability was observed for locules per capsule (100%) followed by plant height (99.75%), seed yield per plant (98.69%), and number of capsules per plant (98.34%).\nThe significant genetic variation observed across all studied traits provides a robust foundation for sesame breeding programs. High heritability estimates (&gt;85%) for all traits indicate that observed phenotypic variation primarily reflects genetic differences rather than environmental effects, facilitating effective selection strategies (Allard 1960; H. Kumar and Garg 2016). The combination of high heritability with high genetic advance for days to flowering, plant height, number of branches per plant, number of capsules per plant, and seed yield per plant suggests predominant additive gene action, making these traits responsive to simple selection methods (Burton 1952; A. Singh and Chaudhary 2006). Genotypic correlation coefficients generally exceeded phenotypic correlations, indicating strong genetic associations among traits. Seed yield per plant showed significant positive correlations with days to flowering (\\(r = 0.321^{*}\\)), plant height (\\(r = 0.633^{**}\\)), number of branches per plant (\\(r = 0.552^{**}\\)), number of capsules per plant (\\(r = 0.956^{**}\\)), locules per capsule (\\(r = 0.312^{*}\\)), and oil content (\\(r = 0.438^{**}\\)).\n\n\n\nTable 4: Genotypic correlation coefficients among traits in sesame genotypes\n\n\n\n\n\nTrait\n\\(X_1\\)\n\\(X_2\\)\n\\(X_3\\)\n\\(X_4\\)\n\\(X_5\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(X_1\\)\n1.000\n0.956**\n0.633**\n0.552**\n0.438**\n\n\n\\(X_2\\)\n0.956**\n1.000\n0.625**\n0.683**\n0.423**\n\n\n\\(X_3\\)\n0.633**\n0.625**\n1.000\n0.582**\n0.491**\n\n\n\\(X_4\\)\n0.552**\n0.683**\n0.582**\n1.000\n0.367*\n\n\n\\(X_5\\)\n0.438**\n0.423**\n0.491**\n0.367*\n1.000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Table 4, the traits denoted by \\(X_1\\) to \\(X_5\\) are:\n\\(X_1\\) – Seed yield per plant (g)\n\\(X_2\\) – Number of capsules per plant\n\\(X_3\\) – Plant height (cm)\n\\(X_4\\) – Number of branches per plant\n\\(X_5\\) – Oil content (%) Correlation significance: p &lt; 0.05 (), p* &lt; 0.01 (**)\n\nNumber of capsules per plant shows the strongest positive correlation with seed yield (\\(r = 0.956^{**}\\)), making it the most reliable indirect selection criterion. Plant height and branches per plant also show strong positive associations, indicating coordinated plant architecture development.

Conversely, number of branches per plant showed the highest negative direct effect (-0.231), followed by days to flowering (-0.108) and oil content (-0.020). The residual effect was 0.203, indicating that approximately 80% of variation in seed yield was explained by the studied traits. The negative direct effect of branches per plant (\\(-0.231\\)) despite positive correlation suggests indirect benefits through increased capsule production. Plant height contributes mainly through indirect effects via capsule production. The analysis explains 79.66% of yield variation, indicating good model adequacy.\n\n3.1 Genetic divergence analysis\nMahalanobis \\(D^2\\) analysis revealed that plant height contributed maximum to total divergence (69.74%), followed by days to flowering (7.56%) and seed yield per plant (6.67%). This indicates plant height as the primary discriminating factor among genotypes.\nPlant height is the major contributor to genetic divergence among sesame genotypes, followed by flowering time and seed yield components as depicted in Figure 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Contribution of traits to total genetic divergence\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Cluster analysis\nThe 40 genotypes were grouped into six distinct clusters. Cluster I was the largest with 30 genotypes, while Clusters III, IV, V, and VI each contained single genotypes. Maximum inter-cluster distance was observed between Clusters III and IV (\\(D^2\\) = 75.04), indicating maximum genetic divergence between these groups.\n\n\n\nTable 6: Cluster distribution of sesame genotypes based on Mahalanobis \\(D^2\\) analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCluster\nGenotypes\nTotal Number of Genotypes\n\n\n\n\nI\nIVTS-06-2, IVTS-06-3, YLM-17, AVTS-06-6, TCR-4865, TCR-3105, VRI-2, IVTS-06-16, IVTS-06-8, AVTS-06-10, TCR-2527-C, IVTS-06-15, AVTS-06-5, AVTS-06-4, IVTS-06-6, AVTS-06-3, AVTS-06-7, AVTS-06-1, AVTS-06-1, IVTS-06-28, IVTS-06-27, IVTS-06-13, TCR-2511, IVTS-06-12, TCR-3279-A, TMV-4, TMV-5, IVTS-06-26, TMV-6, VRI-1\n30\n\n\nII\nTilatara, CO-1, Tilak, Tilarani, TMV-3, Surya\n6\n\n\nIII\nIVTS-06-22\n1\n\n\nIV\nSoma\n1\n\n\nV\nSVPR-1\n1\n\n\nVI\nKYM-1\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCluster means revealed distinct patterns across groups which are represented in Table 7 Cluster VI (KYM-1) showed the earliest flowering (18.73 days) and highest oil content (50.17%), while Cluster IV (Soma) exhibited the tallest plants (107.97 cm) and maximum branches per plant (10.80).

(2015); S. Singh et al. (2020)). This finding has important implications for breeding programs, suggesting that local germplasm may harbor unexploited genetic diversity.\nCluster V (SVPR-1) shows highest yield potential, Cluster IV (Soma) exhibits superior plant architecture, and Cluster VI (KYM-1) offers early maturity with high oil content. Strategic crosses between distant clusters (III × IV) could maximize genetic variation in breeding populations.\nRecent molecular diversity studies using SNP markers have corroborated these findings. Wang et al. (2016) analyzed 705 sesame accessions using genome-wide SNPs and found similar clustering patterns, with genetic diversity being more strongly associated with breeding history than geographical origin. The maximum divergence between Clusters III and IV (\\(D^2 = 75.04\\)) in our study corresponds to regions of low genetic similarity identified in genomic studies (Dossa et al. 2017).\nBased on comprehensive evaluation, several genotypes emerged as superior performers across multiple traits as depicted Figure 2. SVPR-1 demonstrated the highest seed yield (7.02 g/plant), while KYM-1 showed the earliest flowering and highest oil content. Soma exhibited exceptional plant architecture with maximum height and branching.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Performance of elite genotypes for seed yield,oil content and capsules per plant"

    "text": "Discussion\nThe combination of high heritability with high genetic advance for days to flowering, plant height, number of branches per plant, number of capsules per plant, and seed yield per plant suggests predominant additive gene action, making these traits responsive to simple selection methods (Burton 1952; A. Singh and Chaudhary 2006). These findings align with recent reports by Gangwar et al. (2021), Ahmad et al. (2020), and Yahaya et al. (2021), who observed similar patterns in diverse sesame germplasm collections.\nThe strong positive correlation between number of capsules per plant and seed yield (\\(r = 0.9558^{**}\\)) confirms this trait as the most reliable selection criterion for yield improvement. Path analysis further substantiated this relationship by revealing the highest direct effect (1.1063) of capsule number on seed yield. Similar findings have been reported in recent studies by R. Kumar et al. (2019), Gangwar et al. (2021), and Ahmad et al. (2020). The characters plant height, branches per plant, capsules per plant, and oil content showed significant and positive association with seed yield per plant. Therefore, simultaneous improvement of seed yield may be possible through selection of these characters. These matched the reports and conclusions of V. Kumar et al. (2022) and Patel et al. (2023).\nModern breeding programs increasingly utilize these correlation patterns in genomic prediction models. Zhang et al. (2013) demonstrated that incorporating trait correlations into genomic selection algorithms improved prediction accuracy for seed yield by 25% compared to single-trait models. The strong genetic correlations observed in our study suggest that multi-trait selection indices could be particularly effective in sesame breeding (Yu et al. 2019).\nMurthy and Kulkarni (1996) explained that wide adaptability of divergent types could be possible due to factors such as heterogeneity, genetic architecture of the populations, past history of selection, developmental factors, and degree of general combining ability. In the present study, varieties developed at the same location were found to be grouped in different clusters, indicating more divergence. For example, sesame varieties from Kerala Agricultural University were found to be grouped in Clusters II, IV, and VI. This confirms the earlier findings of Raut et al. (1991) that genetic drift and human selection could cause greater diversity than geographical spacing.\nAngadi (1976) reported that varieties in a cluster with a high order of divergence among themselves would be the best breeding materials for achieving maximum genetic advance with regard to yield. Selection within a cluster might also be exercised based on the highest mean performance of the varieties for desirable traits such as seed yield."

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nThis comprehensive genetic analysis of 40 sesame genotypes revealed substantial genetic variability suitable for breeding programs. High heritability estimates coupled with significant genetic advance indicate favorable prospects for genetic improvement through selection. Number of capsules per plant emerged as the most critical trait for yield improvement, while genetic divergence analysis identified optimal parent combinations for hybridization programs.\nThe identification of genetically divergent clusters provides a scientific basis for systematic breeding approaches. Integration of conventional breeding with molecular markers and genomic selection offers promising avenues for accelerating genetic gains. Future breeding efforts should prioritize crosses between genotypes from distant clusters while maintaining focus on high-performing individuals within clusters.\nThe superior genotypes identified in this study (SVPR-1, Soma, KYM-1, and Tilatara) represent valuable genetic resources for developing climate-resilient varieties with enhanced yield potential and oil quality. This research establishes a foundation for modern sesame breeding programs, contributing to the revival of this ancient yet underutilized crop in the context of sustainable agriculture and food security.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcknowledgments\n\n\n\nThe authors acknowledge the support provided by Kerala Agricultural University, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, and National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources for providing the genetic material.

    "title": "Impact of COVID Lockdown on Price Volatility of Pineapple in Vazhakulam, Kerala",
    "section": "1 Introduction",
    "text": "1 Introduction\nPrice volatility is one of the significant sources of risk in agriculture especially in fruits and vegetable production. It is defined as the directionless fluctuations in prices that cannot be predicted with market fundamentals (Prakash 2011). Reasons for price volatility include supply-side shocks due to severe weather events or diseases, variations in demand, distortions in trade policies and supply chain disruptions (Gilbert and Morgan 2010; Ait Sidhoum and Serra 2016). The increasing unpredictability of changing economic and natural environment (Tothova 2011) and seasonal nature of the fruits and vegetables also amplifies price volatility. Moreover, poor shelf life of horticulture crops increases risk and leads to unstable markets (Cook 2011).\nVazhakulam in Ernakulam district has become the major hub for pineapple cultivation in Kerala (Joy 2013). Owing to its unique feature Vazhakulam pineapple has got Geographical indication tag also. Pineapple produced from the region has a long value chain and is marketed to various states like Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Delhi mainly through road ways. Limited quantity of fresh pineapple is being exported to Gulf countries in special packings (Pineapple Growers Association 2018).\nPineapple is a globally traded fruit crop from Kerala that had always been subject to price volatility. It is mainly because of the seasonal variations in demand for pineapple in markets. Climate change induced low production, seasonal disruptions in demand and supply are the main factors that affect price volatility. It was noted that the COVID induced lock down had severely affected the pineapple prices and farmer suicides were reported during the period. This pandemic had a significant negative impact on all sectors of human life, including the economy, food security and health (Saadat, Rawtani, and Hussain 2020). According to (Jribi et al. 2020), the pandemic had the potential to hinder the progress towards meeting several Sustainable Development Goals (United Nations SDG 2015-2030), in particular, SDG 2 (End Hunger) and SDG 12 (Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns). There were widespread disruptions in agriculture supply chain at the beginning of the lockdown (FAO 2021). It further lead to the scarcity of labour, disrupted supply chains and lack of demand and logistics restrictions in the agricultural sector (Cariappa et al. 2021).\nAlthough the price volatility of different agricultural commodities has been researched extensively in recent periods (Gilbert and Morgan 2010; Sabu, Kuruvila, and Manojkumar 2019; Yu et al. 2020), a lack of knowledge exists in the pineapple sector of Kerala. The knowledge about the price risk and volatility associated with the pineapple sector is important for pineapple farmers during the pandemic. This information is critical for developing suitable price risk management strategies, for coping up with similar situations. Hence the present study aims to analyse the price behaviour of Pineapple in Kerala."

    "section": "2 Materials and methods",
    "text": "2 Materials and methods\n\n2.1 Study area\nThe study was conducted in Ernakulam district of Kerala. The study area was selected purposively as it has the largest area under pineapple cultivation in Kerala. Out of the total area under pineapple in Kerala, 58.73 per cent lies in Ernakulam district which produces about 63 per cent of the production of the state in the year (Government of Kerala 2020a). From the district, Muvattupuzha Block Panchayath was purposively selected based on the maximum area under pineapple cultivation. Three pineapple-growing grama panchayats viz., Avoly, Manjalloor, and Kalloorkkad were selected from the block panchayat randomly. Forty farmers each were randomly selected from these grama panchayaths making a total sample size of 120 farmers.\n\n\n2.2 Sampling and data collection\nThe study used time series data of daily prices of pineapple from January 2017 to September 2022 collected from Vazhakulam Pineapple Growers Association(PGA). Price collected can be aptly considered as representative price as most of the pineapple farmers are organized under PGA and trade pineapple through them. The prices represent the farm gate price received by the farmers and it is easily available in the website of Pineapple Growers Association(Pineapple Growers Association 2018). Data on daily prices of pineapple from January 2017 to March 2020 was taken as pre-COVID period and from April 2020 to September 2022 is taken as COVID-post-COVID period. January 2017 to September 2022 was taken as the overall period.\n\n\n2.3 GARCH models\nThe uncertainty surrounding prospective price fluctuation is referred to as volatility. There are different methods to estimate volatility such as historical moving average, Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA), Auto Regressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (ARCH) introduced by Engle (1982) and Generalized Auto-Regressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) introduced by Bollerslev (1986).\nSekhar (2004) compared the price volatility of different agricultural commodities in major Indian and international markets by using GARCH model. This model provided evidence on whether the estimated volatility is statistically significant or not. It also measures the persistence of volatility (Sabu 2015).\nThe ARCH process introduced by Engle (1982) explicitly recognizes the difference between the unconditional and the conditional variance allowing the latter to change over time as a function of past errors. The GARCH model of Bollerslev (1986) is an important type of time series model for heteroscedastic data. It explicitly models a time-varying conditional variance as a linear function of past squared residuals and of its past values. GARCH models are an extension of the ARCH models first introduced by Engle (1982) as it basically introduces a lagged conditional variance to the information set of an ARCH model. An ARCH model applied to price volatility basically assumes that a dependent variable of commodity prices, \\(P_i\\), is generated by the autoregressive process:\n\\[p_i = \\phi_0 + \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\phi_{1} P_{t-1} + \\varepsilon_t \\tag{1}\\]\nTo generate the ARCH\\((p)\\) process, we express the conditional variance of the above expression as a function of its past values squared:\n\\[\\varepsilon_t \\mid \\Omega_{t-1} \\sim N(0, h) \\tag{2}\\]\n\\[h_t^2 = \\delta + \\sum_{i=1}^{p} \\alpha_i \\varepsilon_{t-i}^2 \\tag{3}\\]\nWhere, \\(h_t^2\\) denotes the conditional variance of the information set \\(\\Omega_{t-1}\\) that is available at time \\(t-1\\), and \\(\\delta &gt; 0\\), \\(\\alpha_i \\geq 0\\) for all \\(i = 2 \\ldots p\\) and \\(\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2 + \\cdots + \\alpha_m &lt; 1\\), which are necessary to make \\(\\varepsilon_t^2\\) positive and covariance stationary.\nThe generalization of the ARCH process given in Equation 3 is as follows (Bollerslev 1986):\n\\[\nh_t^2 = \\delta + \\sum_{i=1}^{p} \\alpha_i \\varepsilon_{t-i}^2 + \\sum_{i=1}^{q} \\beta_i h_{t-i}^2\n\\tag{4}\\]\nThe GARCH model in Equation 4 depicts the conditional variance of a price series to depend on a constant, past news about volatility (i.e. the \\(\\varepsilon_{t-1}^2\\) terms). Including the lagged conditional variances might capture the “adaptive learning” phenomenon. The benefit of the GARCH specification is that it contains fewer coefficient restrictions. For a well-defined variance and covariance function: \\(\\delta, \\alpha &gt; 0; \\beta \\geq 0\\), and \\(\\alpha + \\beta &lt; 1\\).\nPersistence of volatility in the commodity series is measured by the sum of \\(\\alpha + \\beta\\). Downward price changes are often followed by higher volatility than upward movements of the same magnitude (Herrera and Espinel 2008).\nModels aim to define volatility clustering and effects such as kurtosis, forming the basis of dynamic volatility models.\nThe key is that volatility, rather than remaining constant or moving in a monotonic manner over time, is dependent on past realisations of the associated volatility i.e. the error variance is related to the squared error terms over several periods in the past (Singh 2020).\nThe ARCH-GARCH model was used to analyse the volatility and it was estimated using R software (R Core Team 2023). From the different models, Standard GARCH (1,1) (SGARCH) model was identified as the best model for this study based on the smallest Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) values (Lestari et al. 2022). This model distinguishes the predictable and unpredictable components of prices and also allows the variance of the unpredictable element to be time-varying. Such time varying conditional variances were estimated by using the SGARCH (1,1) model (Gujarati, Porter, and Gunasekhar 2009) and it was used to identify periods of high volatility.\nThe GARCH(1,1) model is specified as:\n\\[Y_{it} = \\alpha_0 + \\beta_1 P_{t-1} + \\beta_2 P_{t-2} + \\varepsilon_t \\quad ; \\quad t = 1, 2, \\ldots, t \\tag{5}\\]\n\\[\\sigma^2_{i,t} = \\theta + \\alpha_i \\varepsilon^2_{i,t-1} + \\beta_i \\sigma^2_{i,t-1} \\tag{6}\\]\nWhere \\(P_{t-1}\\) is the price at time \\(t-1\\) and \\(\\sigma^2_{i,t}\\) is the conditional error variance at time \\(t\\). The term \\((\\alpha_i + \\beta_i)\\) indicates the degree of persistence in price volatility. If the sum \\((\\alpha_i + \\beta_i)\\) is close to 1, it implies a high level of volatility persistence (Devi, Srikala, and Ananda 2015).\nThe general form of a GARCH(\\(p\\), \\(q\\)) model is:\n\\[\\sigma^2_{i,t} = \\omega + \\sum_{i=1}^{p} \\beta_i \\sigma^2_{t-i} + \\sum_{i=1}^{q} \\alpha_i \\varepsilon^2_{t-i} \\tag{7}\\]\nEquation Equation 5) captures the autoregressive part of the price model, while Equations Equation 6 and Equation 7 describe the time-varying variance component."

    "text": "3 Results\n\n3.1 Average monthly prices behaviour\nIn Vazhakulam, fresh pineapple is harvested at two stages: as green pineapple (harvested at 115 days after the ethephon application) and as ripe pineapple (harvested at 120–125 days after the ethephon application).\nThe present study analyzed the price volatility of both ripe and green pineapple using time series data of daily prices from January 2017 to September 2022. For analytical purposes, the data set was divided into the following three periods:\n\nPre-COVID period: January 2017 to March 2020\n\nCOVID–Post-COVID period: April 2020 to September 2022\n\nThe average monthly prices of both green and ripe pineapple during the pre-COVID and COVID–post-COVID periods are presented in Figure 1 (a) and Figure 1 (b), respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Pre-COVID period\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) COVID-Post-COVID period\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Average monthly prices (Rs./kg) of both green and ripe pineapple in Vazhakulam market during pre-covid and post-covid periods\n\n\n\nPrice of pineapple usually stood high during the summer months of April and May coinciding with summer and one-month long Ramdan fasting. So, many farmers targeted the harvest of the crop during these months. But in April 2020, during the first lockdown period due to strict restrictions, many pineapple plantations were abandoned without harvesting. This was mainly due to the unavailability of migrant labours (as they went back to their hometown fearing the disease). So, a steep decline in price was observed during that period. Prices started increasing as the restrictions were lifted gradually. Again in 2021, there was price drop in the months of May and June due to another lockdown and restrictions.\nThe price drop was to the level of Rs. 10/kg, which put farmers in distress. During the survey, many farmers reported that the price of pineapple had even dipped to Rs. 5/kg during the COVID period as they were not able to transport the produce to the Vazhakulam pineapple market. So, they sold produce in nearby markets. Many of the plantations were kept unharvested and harvested fruits fetched only very low price. Restrictions in interstate and intra state transport, fear of spread of virus through the fruits etc. worsened the situation. Many farmers terminated their lease contracts with landowners before expiry due to financial crisis and were unable to pay the lease amount and continue farming operations. Farmers reported that the reduction in the cultivated area had impacted total pineapple production from Vazhakulam. As the restrictions were gradually lifted towards the end of 2021, situation became normal and price hike was observed due to a reduced supply of pineapple to the market, with the demand for pineapple was same as earlier.\n\n\n3.2 Estimation of volatility using GARCH\nGARCH models are very popular in the analysis of price volatility. Standard GARCH(1,1) model was fitted to study the volatility in the prices of pineapple.

It indicated that the volatility in the prices of pineapple was persistent despite the COVID-induced lockdown.\nIt is evident from Table 1 that the sum of coefficients \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) for the prices of ripe pineapple was higher in the COVID-post-COVID period, followed by the overall period. This indicated higher volatility in the prices of ripe pineapple during the COVID-post-COVID period. A similar trend was observed in the price of green pineapple (Table 2). This might be related to the reduced demand for pineapple in the market as a result of changes in the consumption behaviour of people during the pandemic. A study conducted by Yu et al. (2020) on the impact of COVID-19 on the prices of major food products in China found that rice and wheat showed no significant changes in prices after the COVID lockdown, whereas prices of cabbage showed higher volatility.\nAmong the green and ripe pineapple prices, higher volatility was observed in the prices of green pineapple as compared to ripe pineapple for all the periods—pre-COVID, COVID-post-COVID, and overall. The value of the \\(\\alpha + \\beta\\) term for green pineapple prices was close to one (0.916) during the post-COVID period, which indicated higher volatility in the prices of green pineapple after the lockdown. This could be because the effect of transportation restrictions during the lockdown on green pineapple was greater as it was marketed to North India, whereas mature ripe pineapple was marketed in Kerala and nearby states. In a similar attempt, while studying the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the prices of rice, chilli, and garlic in Indonesia, it was found that due to the government’s different social assistance programs, the impact of COVID-19 on the prices of rice was negligible, whereas the prices of chilli and garlic had decreased due to the pandemic. The study also found that the effect of COVID-19 on the prices of horticultural products was higher as compared to that on the prices of food grains (Zahraturrahmi et al. 2021).\n\n\n3.3 Volatility clustering\nTo provide more detailed insights in to the volatility in price of pineapple, the volatility clustering in daily prices of both green and ripe pineapple for pre-COVID, COVID-post-COVID and overall periods are shown in Figure 2 given below. These figures clearly underpin the estimated results of GARCH model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Pre-COVID period green pineapple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Pre-COVID period ripe pineapple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) COVID-post-COVID period green pineapple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) COVID-post-COVID period ripe pineapple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(e) Overall period green pineapple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(f) Overall period ripe pineapple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Volatility clustering in daily prices of green and ripe pineapple during pre-COVID, COVID-post-COVID, and overall periods.\n\n\n\nThe Figure 2 indicated that there was volatility in the prices of pineapple. But the volatility was more prominent during the COVID-post-COVID period. A lowest price of Rs.10 per kg was realized during the COVID period and it recovered gradually to Rs.60 per kg during the post-COVID period. According to Pineapple Growers Association Kerala, the farm gate price had come down to Rs.10 per kg compared to Rs.40 in the previous year due to lockdown (Kumar 2020). Thus, the pineapple farmers were in distress and they were unable to pay off their debts. There was also a report of farmer suicide due to financial losses in pineapple cultivation (Government of Kerala 2020b).\nIn a similar attempt, (Kaur 2021) in her study observed persistence of volatility in the prices of cereals, pulses and fruits before and after COVID-19. (Arumugam, Kanagavalli, and Manida 2020) revealed that the problem of labour shortage caused by a fear of viral transmission led to the wastage of harvested commodities, primarily fruits and vegetables, and also demand reduction of produce in the market. In a study conducted by (Pandya et al. 2021), the prices of all agricultural items dropped by about 70 percent due to a rapid drop in demand and an excess supply of farm products. According to (Hossain et al. 2020), COVID-19 not only affected physical health but also affected the mental health of farmers."

    "section": "Discussion",
    "text": "Discussion\nThe present study highlights the significant volatility in pineapple prices across pre-COVID, COVID-post-COVID, and overall periods in the Vazhakulam market. Results from the GARCH(1,1) model indicated that both green and ripe pineapple prices experienced persistent volatility, with a pronounced increase during the COVID-post-COVID period. This was evident from the higher \\(\\alpha + \\beta\\) values observed, especially for green pineapple, suggesting a strong memory in the price volatility process during this period.\nSeveral factors contributed to this heightened volatility. The COVID lockdowns imposed transport and logistics constraints and disrupted supply chains which caused a temporary collapse in market demand. This was reflected in steep price drops, with the price of pineapple falling as low as Rs 10 per kg during the lockdown, as reported by the Pineapple Growers Association (Kumar 2020). The inability to harvest or transport produce due to labour shortages further aggravated the situation (Arumugam, Kanagavalli, and Manida 2020).\nThe findings are consistent with similar studies on other horticultural commodities. (Kaur 2021) found continued volatility in food prices post-COVID, and (Pandya et al. 2021) noted an average price drop of 70% in farm produce during the early pandemic phase. Moreover, the psychological and financial stress induced by the pandemic led to cases of farmer distress and suicide, further underlining the socioeconomic impact (Hossain et al. 2020).\nIt was also evident that green pineapple prices were more volatile than ripe ones, potentially due to their greater dependence on inter-state transport, especially to North Indian markets. These insights underscore the vulnerability of perishable commodity sectors to external shocks and reinforce the need for effective price risk management, timely market intelligence, and supportive agricultural policy interventions."

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nPineapple cultivation remains a remunerative agricultural activity for many farmers in Kerala, particularly because it is one of the major fruit crops transported from the state to other parts of India. This study examined the price volatility in the Vazhakulam pineapple market during the pre-COVID, COVID-post-COVID, and overall periods. Findings revealed that pineapple farmers in Kerala have historically faced frequent price fluctuations, with significantly heightened volatility observed during the COVID-post-COVID period. This increase was primarily attributed to transportation restrictions and a fall in market demand due to the pandemic.\nThese results have important implications for policymakers. To stabilize the pineapple market, there is a need to develop more robust price risk management mechanisms. Although the Government of Kerala has fixed a base price of Rs 15 per kg for pineapple (Government of Kerala 2020b), the study found the average cost of production to be Rs 17.33 per kg. Therefore, it is recommended that the base price be revised to at least Rs 20–22 per kg to ensure profitability. The findings highlight the need for targeted policy support and risk management strategies to stabilize pineapple marketsin Kerala and protect farmer livelihoods during times of crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcknowledgments\n\n\n\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the support and encouragement provided by Kerala Agricultural University. They also sincerely thank the respondent farmers for their valuable time and cooperation during the course of the study."

To address this gap, a field experiment was conducted in 2023 on the coastal sandy loam soils of Kayamkulam, Kerala, to assess the impact of different biochar rates on okra yield, nutrient uptake, and soil fertility. The study followed a randomized block design with nine treatments: various combinations of biochar (5 and 10 t ha\\(^{-1}\\)), farmyard manure (5 and 20 t ha\\(^{-1}\\)), and two nutrient levels (75% and 100% RDF). Results revealed that the application of biochar at 10 t ha\\(^{-1}\\) along with the recommended nutrient dose (110:35:70 kg N:P\\(_2\\)O\\(_5\\):K\\(_2\\)O ha\\(^{-1}\\)) significantly improved okra yield and nutrient uptake while enhancing soil fertility. The findings highlight the potential of biochar as a soil conditioner and underscore the importance of application rate for achieving optimal benefits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImpact of COVID Lockdown on Price Volatility of Pineapple in Vazhakulam, Kerala\n\n\n\n\n\nCase-Study\n\n\nEconomics\n\n\nPolicy\n\n\n\n\nArshad N., Aswathy Vijayan*, Durga A.

Verdc.] is a distinct form of cowpea cultivated in southern Asia and the Far East for its immature pods. Six parameter generation mean analysis of three cowpea crosses revealed complex gene action for several yield-related traits. Significant scale tests and epistasis indicated the inadequacy of the simple additive-dominance model, underscoring the role of non-allelic interactions in trait inheritance. Additive × additive, additive × dominance, and dominance × dominance effects were observed for traits such as pod length, pod yield per plant, pods per plant, and root weight. The presence of duplicate and complementary epistasis suggests that hybridization followed by selection in segregating generations would be effective for improving these traits. Traits like pod breadth, seeds per pod, and 100-seed weight, which lacked significant epistasis, can be improved using additive-dominance models. Recombination breeding is recommended for enhancing pod yield and pod weight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRAISINS: Integrating R and AI for Agricultural Data Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginal-Article\n\n\nData-Science\n\n\nSoftware\n\n\n\n\nMohammed Hisham M., Jithin Chandran, Pratheesh P Gopinath*\n\n\n\n\nJun 8, 2025\n\n\nRAISINS (R and AI Solutions for INferential Statistics) is a web-based statistical analysis platform designed to bridge the gap between complex inferential methods and the practical needs of students and researchers, particularly in the agricultural sciences.

    "section": "1 Introduction",
    "text": "1 Introduction\nIn India, the agricultural waste generated by crops is significantly higher than in many other countries. Due to the lack of suitable technologies for effective disposal, farmers often resort to burning the crop residues as a quick and convenient method to clear fields. According to Singh and Kaskaoutis (2014), about 43% of the total crop stubbles produced in India is burnt in-situ, contributing substantially to air pollution. One promising solution to mitigate the environmental impact of crop residue burning is the conversion of crop residues into biochar, a carbon rich material produced through pyrolysis. Punnoose and Anitha (2015) has reported that biomass possesses several beneficial physical properties including low bulk density, high porosity, and higher water holding capacity. When applied to soil, these properties make biochar, an effective soil conditioner, enhancing both water and nutrient retention in soil and improves the crop yield. In Kerala, tender coconut husk is a prominent form of agricultural waste which requires efficient and ecofriendly disposal methods. Although, a portion of this agricultural waste is currently utilized through composting or as mulch in coconut gardens, these practices are insufficient relative to the large volume of waste produced. The dried tender coconut husk holds significant potential for conversion into biochar, which can then be recycled back into agricultural use to boost soil productivity. The Onattukara tract spread over three districts of Kerala (Alappuzha, Kollam and Pathanamthitta) presents a unique challenge due to its coarse textured, sandy loam soils with inherently low nutrient status. This type of soil is prone to nutrient leaching, especially during rainfall, rendering the applied fertilizers as less effective. Given biochar’s ability to improve soil moisture retention and reduce nutrient leaching, it represents a promising amendment for such type of soils. Therefore, a study was conducted to evaluate the potential of tender coconut husk biochar as a soil conditioner for okra cultivation in the sandy loam soils of Onattukara region."

    "text": "2 Materials and methods\nA field experiment was conducted during the summer of 2023 in the wetlands of the Instructional Farm attached to Onattukara Regional Agricultural Research Station, Kayamkulam, Kerala. The research station is situated at 9.177° North latitude and 76.517° East longitude and at an altitude of 3.05 m above mean sea level. The treatments were laid out in randomized block design comprising of eight treatment combinations of biochar along with two levels of recommended dose of nutrients for okra along with a control and were replicated thrice. The treatments were t1 (biochar @ \\(5\\ \\text{t ha}^{-1}\\) + 100% RDF)1, t2 (biochar @ \\(10\\ \\text{t ha}^{-1}\\) + 100% RDF), t3 (biochar @ \\(5\\ \\text{t ha}^{-1}\\) + \\(5\\ \\text{t ha}^{-1}\\) FYM + 100% RDF)2, t4 (biochar @ \\(10\\ \\text{t ha}^{-1}\\) + \\(5\\ \\text{t ha}^{-1}\\) FYM + 100% RDF), t5 (biochar @ \\(5\\ \\text{t ha}^{-1}\\) + 75% RDF), t6 (biochar @ \\(10\\ \\text{t ha}^{-1}\\) + 75% RDF), t7 (biochar @ \\(5\\ \\text{t ha}^{-1}\\) + \\(5\\ \\text{t ha}^{-1}\\) FYM + 75% RDF), t8 (biochar @ \\(10\\ \\text{t ha}^{-1}\\) + \\(5\\ \\text{t ha}^{-1}\\) FYM + 75% RDF), and t9 (KAU POP (2016)-\\(20\\ \\text{t ha}^{-1}\\) FYM + 100% RDF).\nPrior to sowing, the experimental area was cleared of stubbles and clods were broken thoroughly. Dolomite was applied uniformly at the rate of 1 t ha\\(^{-1}\\) and was incorporated in soil during primary tillage. The field was laid out as per the treatment design. After the layout, biochar and farmyard manure, along with half N, full P and full K of chemical fertilizers were applied in soil as per the treatments just before sowing. The remaining N was given in soil at one month after sowing along with intercultural operations and earthing up. The seeds of okra var. Arka Anamika were sown in lines in the main field at a spacing of 60 cm × 30 cm. The crop was sown during the last week of January 2023. After sowing, uniform population was maintained by thinning and gap filling. Five random plants from each net plot were selected and tagged as observational plants for recording observations.\nThe number of days taken for the first flower to open was noted and the mean was worked out. To find the number of fruits per plant, the fruits obtained from different harvests from each of the five observational plants were recorded separately and the average was worked out. The length of the fruits, from the tip of the fruit to the stalk end, was measured from the observational plants and the average was calculated and expressed in cm. The weight of the fruits harvested from each of the observational plants was recorded after each harvest. After the final harvest, the total weight of fruits obtained from the observational plants at different harvests were worked out, averaged and expressed in kilograms for fruit yield per plant. The weight of fruits from each plot excluding the border plants was recorded after each harvest and summed at the end of the cropping season to compute the yield in terms of kg per plot and was converted into t ha\\(^{-1}\\).\nThe harvest index was calculated using the following formula suggested by Donald and Hamblin (1976). It was calculated by dividing the economic yield with biological yield of the plant. Sample plants collected from each plot were chopped into small pieces and were sun dried. After the initial drying, the samples were dried in oven to attain constant weight. The samples were then ground to pass through a 0.5 mm mesh and the required quantity of samples were digested and used for nutrient analysis following standard procedures. The nutrient uptake was calculated and expressed in kg ha\\(^{-1}\\) according to Equation 1.\n\\[\\text{Nutrient uptake (kg ha}^{-1}\\text{)} = \\frac{\\text{Nutrient content (\\%)} \\times \\text{Dry matter production (kg ha}^{-1}\\text{)}}{100} \\tag{1}\\]\nThe composite soil samples from the field before the experiment and from each plot after the experiment were collected, air dried, powdered and passed through a 2 mm sieve and analysed for physico-chemical properties of the soil (Table 1). The soil samples passed through 0.2 mm sieve were used for organic carbon estimation.

    "text": "3 Results\n\n3.1 Yield and plant performance\nThe application of biochar significantly influenced certain yield traits of okra. Days to flowering ranged between 35 and 37 days after sowing (DAS) across all treatments, but the differences were not statistically significant. Similarly, the number of fruits per plant and fruit length did not differ significantly among treatments. However, fruit yield per plant was significantly affected by biochar application (Table 2). Treatment t4 resulted in the highest fruit yield per plant (\\(544.93\\ \\text{g}\\)) and was statistically at par with t3 (\\(537.74\\ \\text{g}\\)), while the lowest was recorded in t9 (\\(380.24\\ \\text{g}\\)). Yield per hectare followed a similar trend, with t4 yielding \\(15.71\\ \\text{t ha}^{-1}\\) and was found to be on par with t3 (\\(14.07\\ \\text{t ha}^{-1}\\)), and the lowest yield observed in t9 (\\(7.65\\ \\text{t ha}^{-1}\\)). The harvest index was also positively influenced, with t3 registering the highest value (\\(0.81\\)), which was statistically similar to t4 (\\(0.81\\)), t2 (\\(0.79\\)), t1 (\\(0.79\\)), and t8 (\\(0.77\\)).\n\n\n3.2 Nutrient uptake\nThe nutrient uptake of okra plants varied across treatments. Nitrogen uptake was significantly higher in t4 (\\(101.35\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)), which was on par with t3, t2, t6, and t5. The lowest N uptake (\\(74.78\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)) was recorded in t9. Phosphorus uptake was highest in t7 (\\(24.76\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)), statistically similar to t8, t6, t5, and t3, while t2 had the lowest (\\(14.90\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)). Potassium uptake was not significantly affected by any treatment. For calcium, t6 showed the highest uptake (\\(64.94\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)), comparable to t3, t7, and t4. Magnesium uptake was also significantly influenced, with t4 showing the highest uptake (\\(20.47\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)), on par with t3, t6, and t8. Sulphur uptake did not differ significantly across treatments. Copper uptake was highest in t1 (\\(1.82\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)), followed closely by t3 (\\(1.73\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)), while the lowest was in t6 (\\(0.89\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)). Zinc and boron uptakes were not significantly influenced by treatments. Iron uptake was significantly higher in t6 (\\(0.96\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)), which was at par with t1 and t3. Manganese uptake was highest in t8 (\\(1.69\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)), statistically similar to t7, t4, and t2.\n\n\n3.3 Soil properties\nPost-harvest soil analysis revealed that biochar application significantly influenced several soil physico-chemical parameters. Water holding capacity was significantly higher in t4 (\\(33.87\\%\\)), followed by t8, t3, t2, and t7. Bulk density was lowest in t8 (\\(1.21\\ \\text{Mg m}^{-3}\\)), while t9 recorded the highest (\\(1.30\\ \\text{Mg m}^{-3}\\)). No significant differences were found in soil pH, electrical conductivity (EC), or cation exchange capacity (CEC). Organic carbon content increased significantly with biochar application, highest in t4 (\\(1.29\\%\\)), and statistically comparable to t8, t3, t2, t7, t1, and t6. Available nitrogen content also improved, with t4 (\\(209.07\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)) showing significantly higher values, followed by t3, t8, and t7. However, the availability of phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sulphur, copper, zinc, iron, boron, and manganese in the soil was not significantly affected by the treatments.\n\n\n\nTable 2: Effect of treatments on the yield attributes and yield of okra\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTreatment\nDays to Flowering\nNo. of Fruits/Plant\nFruit Length (cm)\nFruit Yield/Plant (g)\nFruit Yield (\\(\\text{t ha}^{-1}\\))\nHarvest Index\n\n\n\n\nt1\n38.67\n18.00\n15.90\n480.30\n10.44\n0.79\n\n\nt2\n38.67\n18.12\n16.07\n487.23\n12.25\n0.79\n\n\nt3\n38.44\n19.90\n16.28\n537.74\n14.07\n0.81\n\n\nt4\n38.67\n20.23\n16.34\n544.93\n15.71\n0.81\n\n\nt5\n38.67\n16.11\n15.55\n392.85\n11.26\n0.74\n\n\nt6\n38.78\n16.79\n15.74\n415.59\n11.89\n0.76\n\n\nt7\n38.89\n17.45\n15.81\n457.61\n12.19\n0.77\n\n\nt8\n38.67\n17.56\n15.85\n464.61\n13.05\n0.77\n\n\nt9\n38.67\n16.11\n15.40\n380.24\n7.65\n0.75\n\n\nSEm (±)\n0.14\n1.33\n0.35\n16.81\n0.63\n0.01\n\n\nCD (0.05)\nNS\nNS\nNS\n50.385\n1.890\n0.037\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Effect of treatments on nutrient uptake of okra (N, P, and K)\n\n\n\n\n\nTreatment\nN (kg ha\\(^{-1}\\))\nP (kg ha\\(^{-1}\\))\nK (kg ha\\(^{-1}\\))\n\n\n\n\nt1\n87.85\n17.07\n51.93\n\n\nt2\n92.90\n14.90\n49.52\n\n\nt3\n95.93\n19.60\n53.88\n\n\nt4\n101.35\n18.45\n46.64\n\n\nt5\n91.93\n19.98\n46.68\n\n\nt6\n92.70\n22.57\n55.40\n\n\nt7\n88.15\n24.76\n46.47\n\n\nt8\n84.43\n23.73\n50.65\n\n\nt9\n74.78\n17.87\n45.96\n\n\nSEm (±)\n4.29\n1.86\n3.42\n\n\nCD (0.05)\n12.848\n5.561\nNS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4: Effect of treatments on uptake of nutrients by okra (all values in kg ha\\(^{-1}\\))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTreatment\nCa\nMg\nS\nCu\nZn\nFe\nB\nMn\n\n\n\n\nt1\n53.28\n18.27\n3.00\n1.82\n1.86\n0.88\n0.30\n1.36\n\n\nt2\n52.78\n18.00\n3.10\n1.70\n1.83\n0.47\n0.34\n1.46\n\n\nt3\n59.72\n19.84\n3.06\n1.73\n1.85\n0.82\n0.32\n1.40\n\n\nt4\n58.61\n20.47\n3.14\n1.19\n1.92\n0.44\n0.34\n1.67\n\n\nt5\n54.39\n16.54\n3.03\n0.67\n1.92\n0.67\n0.30\n1.42\n\n\nt6\n64.94\n19.61\n3.05\n0.89\n1.85\n0.96\n0.33\n1.61\n\n\nt7\n59.38\n18.66\n2.98\n1.09\n2.04\n0.74\n0.31\n1.68\n\n\nt8\n56.25\n19.60\n3.07\n1.34\n2.01\n0.78\n0.33\n1.69\n\n\nt9\n41.10\n18.68\n2.98\n1.68\n1.93\n0.78\n0.31\n1.39\n\n\nSEm (±)\n2.21\n0.35\n0.05\n0.04\n0.18\n0.05\n0.02\n0.08\n\n\nCD (0.05)\n6.610\n1.061\nNS\n0.111\nNS\n0.151\nNS\n0.251\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5: Effect of treatments on soil parameters after harvest of okra\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTreatment\nWHC (%)\nBulk Density (Mg m\\(^{-3}\\))\npH\nEC (dS m\\(^{-1}\\))\nCEC (cmol(+) kg\\(^{-1}\\))\nOrganic Carbon (%)\n\n\n\n\nt1\n30.78\n1.26\n5.48\n0.03\n3.11\n1.19\n\n\nt2\n32.65\n1.22\n5.78\n0.03\n3.12\n1.23\n\n\nt3\n32.73\n1.23\n5.59\n0.02\n3.06\n1.25\n\n\nt4\n33.87\n1.22\n5.87\n0.03\n3.11\n1.29\n\n\nt5\n29.45\n1.24\n5.66\n0.02\n3.08\n1.10\n\n\nt6\n30.91\n1.22\n5.76\n0.09\n3.09\n1.17\n\n\nt7\n32.61\n1.22\n5.67\n0.04\n3.11\n1.23\n\n\nt8\n33.02\n1.21\n5.84\n0.02\n3.07\n1.26\n\n\nt9\n27.52\n1.30\n5.31\n0.03\n3.05\n0.96\n\n\nSEm (±)\n0.57\n0.00\n0.11\n0.03\n0.04\n0.05\n\n\nCD (0.05)\n1.695\n0.008\nNS\nNS\nNS\n0.134\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 6: Effect of treatments on primary nutrient status of soil after the experiment (all values in kg ha\\(^{-1}\\))\n\n\n\n\n\nTreatment\nAvailable N\nAvailable P\nAvailable K\n\n\n\n\nt1\n188.16\n76.91\n161.43\n\n\nt2\n188.16\n79.63\n152.13\n\n\nt3\n196.52\n76.36\n146.46\n\n\nt4\n209.07\n94.90\n172.70\n\n\nt5\n163.07\n80.72\n189.47\n\n\nt6\n163.07\n82.73\n159.64\n\n\nt7\n196.52\n88.00\n172.03\n\n\nt8\n196.52\n75.09\n173.26\n\n\nt9\n183.98\n73.63\n149.74\n\n\nSEm (±)\n6.97\n7.08\n10.63\n\n\nCD (0.05)\n20.890\nNS\nNS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 7: Effect of treatments on secondary and micronutrient status of soil after the experiment (all values in mg kg\\(^{-1}\\))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTreatment\nEx.3 Ca\nEx.

    "section": "4 Discussion",
    "text": "4 Discussion\n\n4.1 Yield attributes\nThe treatments did not influence the days taken to flower in okra. In general, regardless of the treatments, the okra plants started to flower between 35 DAS and 37 DAS. The number of fruits per plant and length of fruits were not influenced by biochar. However, the fruit yield per plant was significantly improved by the incorporation of biochar. The highest yield per plant was obtained from t4 (\\(544.93\\ \\text{g}\\)) and was found to be on a par with the treatment t3 (\\(537.74\\ \\text{g}\\) per plant). There was 35.60 per cent increase over t9. Higher fruit yield per plant was observed for the plants that received biochar and FYM along with 100 per cent recommended dose of fertilizers (RDF). The adsorbing property of biochar in sandy loam soil might have slowed down the release of nutrients from FYM and chemical fertilizers. As the amount of biochar was doubled, there was an increase in fresh weight of fruits. This is in accordance with the findings of Dainy (2015) who also reported a progressive increment in the yield characters in yard long bean as the levels of biochar was enhanced from 10 to 30 t ha\\(^{-1}\\) when applied along with the recommended dose of fertilizers. Similar reports of increased yield with the incorporation of biochar and RDF were also reported by Punnoose (2015) in amaranthus and Hashmi et al. (2019) in Pisum sativum L. In the case of fruit yield ha\\(^{-1}\\), the application of tender coconut husk biochar had significantly improved the yield per hectare in okra. Higher fruit yield per hectare was observed for the treatment t4 (\\(15.71\\ \\text{t}\\)) and was on par with t3 (\\(14.07\\ \\text{t}\\)). The control plants (t9) could only produce \\(7.65\\ \\text{t ha}^{-1}\\). Overall, there was a yield increase of 69 per cent in t4 compared to t9. The lower yield in t9 might be due to the leaching loss of nutrients. There was 44 mm rainfall during the growth period of okra at Onattukara which might have aggravated the leaching loss in the sandy loam soils of Onattukara. Nagula (2017) had also recommended the application of biochar (\\(@\\) 10 kg ha\\(^{-1}\\)) along with RDN for higher yield in banana. The harvest index was also significantly influenced by the treatments. The treatment t3 recorded a higher harvest index of \\(0.81\\) and was found to be on a par with the treatments t4 (\\(0.81\\)), t2 (\\(0.79\\)), t1 (\\(0.79\\)) and t8 (\\(0.77\\)). Thus, biochar as a soil conditioner along with FYM and full recommended dose of fertilizers was effective for okra in the sandy loam soils of Onattukara.\n\n\n4.2 Nutrient uptake\nThe N uptake in okra was significantly improved due to the treatments. Among the treatments, the highest N uptake was recorded by the treatment t4 (\\(101.35\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)) and was found to be on a par with t3 (\\(95.93\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)), t2 (\\(92.90\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)), t6 (\\(92.70\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)) and t5 (\\(91.93\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)). Lower N uptake was recorded in t9. There was an increase of 30.14 percent in the N uptake (t4) compared to control (t9). This might be due to the adsorbing capacity of biochar applied as soil conditioner. The higher CEC for biochar might have helped in retaining N in the sandy loam soils of Onattukara. The full RDN along with FYM (5 t ha\\(^{-1}\\)), combined with the adsorbing property of biochar might have contributed to a higher status of available N in soil and led to an increased uptake of N by okra. Dainy (2015) had earlier reported that the total N uptake in yard long bean was found to increase from \\(51.19\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\) to \\(105.50\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\) due to the application of biochar, PGPR and full recommended dose of nutrients. Jabin (2022) had also reported that total N uptake was higher in ginger when treated with paddy husk biochar (30 t ha\\(^{-1}\\)) along with full dose of fertilizers in sandy soils. Similarly, Nigussie et al. (2012) had also reported a higher N uptake in lettuces grown in soils conditioned with 10 t ha\\(^{-1}\\) biochar suggesting the prospects of biochar to raise fertilizer use efficiency in soils where N loss is high.\nA significant difference was observed in P uptake among the treatments. Higher P uptake was observed for t7 (\\(24.76\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)) and was on a par with t8 (\\(23.73\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)), t6 (\\(22.57\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)), t5 (\\(19.98\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)) and t3 (\\(19.60\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)). This increase in P uptake might be due to the higher quantity of available P in soil which is evident from the soil samples collected after the harvest of okra (Table 6). In acidic soils, the solubility of P and its uptake by plants depends mainly on the formation of Al and Fe-phosphates in soil. When biochar is applied to acidic soil condition, it raises the soil pH. There is a reduction in the P binding to Fe and Al oxides, thus making P available in soil. Similar reports of improved P availability in acid soils due to supplementation of biochar was observed by Chintala et al. (2014) and H. Zhang et al. (2016). On the contrary, Dainy (2015) and Jabin (2022) had reported a higher P uptake in yard long bean and ginger, treated with biochar along with NPK as per KAU POP (2016). The uptake of K was not significantly influenced by the treatments.\nSignificant effect for Ca uptake was observed in okra (Table 4). The highest Ca uptake was recorded by the treatment t6 (\\(64.94\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)) and was noticed to be on a par with treatment t3 (\\(59.72\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)), t7 (\\(59.38\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)) and t4 (\\(58.61\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)). Lower Ca uptake was recorded by the treatment t9 (KAU POP). There was an overall increase of calcium uptake by 44.96% in t6 compared to the control t9. The application of biochar along with liming prior to planting okra was found to improve the availability of calcium in soil which might have led to an increased plant uptake. Earlier, Sombroek, Nachtergaele, and Hebel (1993) had also reported increased calcium availability for plant growth after the application of biochar due to the higher surface area, negative surface charge and charge density. Moreover, calcium in biochar may exchange Al ions present on the soil organic matter and enhance the availability of calcium for plants thus, guiding it to an increased calcium uptake by the plants (Novak et al. 2009). Dainy (2015) had also reported higher Ca uptake in yard long bean due to the application of biochar. In sandy soils, Jabin (2022) also observed a higher calcium uptake in ginger.\nThe uptake of Mg was observed to be significant (Table 4). The treatment t4 resulted in higher Mg uptake (\\(20.47\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)) by okra and was noticed to be on a par with the treatment t3 (\\(19.84\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)), t6 (\\(19.61\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)) and t8 (\\(19.60\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)). The Mg in soil increases with increase in soil pH. There was an increment in soil pH from the initial value of 5.38 (Table 1) to 5.87 (Table 5) due to application of biochar in combination with the effect of liming. This might have improved the exchangeable magnesium in soil which has resulted in an increased magnesium uptake in okra. Jabin (2022) has also reported an increased magnesium uptake in ginger due to application of biochar. Tender coconut husk biochar had 0.13 percent magnesium (Vikram et al. 2024). This might have contributed to the higher magnesium content in t4. Dainy (2015) had also reported an increase in total Mg uptake in yard long bean when biochar (@ 20 t ha\\(^{-1}\\)) was applied with RDN. The uptake of sulphur was not significantly influenced by the treatments.\nCopper uptake was found to be significant (Table 4) for the treatments. Higher copper uptake in okra was observed for the treatment t1 (\\(1.82\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)) and was found to be on a par with the treatment t3 (\\(1.73\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)). There was an increase in copper content in soil from \\(1.31\\ \\text{mg kg}^{-1}\\) (Table 1) to \\(1.45\\ \\text{mg kg}^{-1}\\) (Table 7) due to the application of biochar. This might have contributed to the increased uptake of copper in okra. Similar reports of increased copper uptake were noticed in yard long beans by Dainy (2015) and in rice by Salvacion and Pangga (2020) due to the application of biochar.\nThe uptake of zinc was not significantly influenced by the treatments. The uptake of iron in okra was found to be significant (Table 4). Higher iron uptake was observed for t6 (\\(0.96\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)) and was perceived to be on a par with treatment t1 (\\(0.88\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)) and t3 (\\(0.82\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)). The biochar produced from tender coconut husk contains \\(107.58\\ \\text{mg kg}^{-1}\\) of iron (Vikram et al. 2024), and hence its application as a soil conditioner had increased the soil iron content. The initial soil available iron was \\(14.74\\ \\text{mg kg}^{-1}\\) (Table 1) and was increased to \\(15.53\\ \\text{mg kg}^{-1}\\) (t6 – Table 7) due to the application of biochar. This might be the reason for the increased availability of iron in soil which might have contributed to the increased iron uptake in t6 treatment. Similar report of increased iron uptake in yard long bean was observed by Dainy (2015).\nThe uptake of boron was not significantly influenced by the treatments. The uptake of manganese was found to be significantly influenced by the treatments (Table 4). Among the treatments, the highest uptake of manganese was recorded by the treatment t8 (\\(1.69\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)) and was observed to be on a par with treatment t7 (\\(1.68\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)), t4 (\\(1.67\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)), t6 (\\(1.61\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)) and t2 (\\(1.46\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)). The application of biochar had slightly improved the soil available manganese. This might have improved the plant uptake of manganese in okra. Earlier, Dainy (2015) had also reported the increase in total uptake of manganese from \\(559.93\\) to \\(1140.50\\ \\text{g ha}^{-1}\\) due to application of biochar in yard long bean."

    "text": "5 Soil attributes\nThe soil water holding capacity after cultivation of okra was significantly modified due to the treatments. The initial water holding capacity of the soil from the experimental area (Table 1) was \\(10.47\\%\\). The treatment t4 recorded a significantly higher WHC (\\(33.87\\%\\)) and was found on a par with t8 (\\(33.02\\%\\)), t3 (\\(32.73\\%\\)), t2 (\\(32.65\\%\\)) and t7 (\\(32.61\\%\\)). An increase of \\(20.68\\%\\) in water holding capacity was observed in t4 (compared to control). An overall increase of \\(105.55\\%\\) of WHC could be obtained due to application of biochar in the sandy loam soils of Onattukara. The initial analysis of tender coconut husk biochar had revealed that it had a water holding capacity of \\(232.34\\%\\). This biochar when applied to soil reduces the bulk density of soil and is the reason for the higher water holding capacity of the soil. There was \\(57.92\\%\\) increase in WHC with the application of biochar along with NPK as per POP recommendation (Dainy 2015). Wang et al. (2019) has also reported that biochar can temporarily increase the field capacity due to their higher pore volume in a coarse textured soil.\nThe bulk density of soil was found to be significantly reduced by the treatments. The initial bulk density of the soil from the experimental area was \\(1.61\\ \\text{Mg m}^{-3}\\). In general, biochar had significantly reduced the soil’s bulk density. KAU 2016 (t9) recorded the highest bulk density (\\(1.30\\ \\text{Mg m}^{-3}\\)) in soil and the lowest was recorded for the treatment t8 (\\(1.21\\ \\text{Mg m}^{-3}\\)). Overall, there was a reduction in bulk density by \\(28.37\\%\\) compared to the initial value indicating the potential for increased water holding capacity. There are several reports of decreased bulk density with application of biochar (Laird et al. 2010; Jones, Haynes, and Phillips 2010; Chen et al. 2011; Mankasingh, Choi, and Ragnarsdottir 2011; A. Zhang et al. 2012). Dainy (2015) had also reported in yard long bean that the application of biochar had lowered the bulk density of soil. The pH, electrical conductivity and CEC in soil after the experiment was not significantly influenced by the treatments.\nThe organic carbon content of the soil after the experiment was significantly governed by the treatments. Higher organic carbon was noticed for t4 (\\(1.29\\%\\)) and was on par with t8 (\\(1.26\\%\\)), t3 (\\(1.25\\%\\)), t2 (\\(1.23\\%\\)), t7 (\\(1.23\\%\\)), t1 (\\(1.19\\%\\)) and t6 (\\(1.17\\%\\)). The control treatment (t9) recorded the lowest organic carbon content (\\(0.96\\%\\)). There was an overall increase of \\(29.33\\%\\) in t4 compared to KAU (2016) due to the application of biochar. The initial organic carbon content in soil before the experiment was \\(0.53\\%\\) (Table 1). Biochar produced from tender coconut husk had a total organic carbon content of \\(48.14\\%\\) (Vikram et al. 2024), and application of this might have helped in the increased carbon content in biochar applied plants. In amaranthus, Punnoose and Anitha (2015) had also reported higher organic carbon content in biochar applied plants.\nThere were significant effects on available N in soil. Higher available N was observed for t4 (\\(209.07\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\)) and was on a par with the treatments t3, t7 and t8 with \\(196.52\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\). This might be due to the increased retention of nitrogen in soil due to the application of biochar. Punnoose (2015) had also reported an increased nutrient content in biochar applied soils. The control (t9) recorded an available N content of \\(183.98\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\). There was \\(44\\ \\text{mm}\\) of rain during the crop period which might have leached out the available N in soil leading to a comparatively lesser available N in soil. The lowest available N was recorded for t5 and t6 with \\(163.07\\ \\text{kg ha}^{-1}\\). The lower dose of fertilizer without the application of FYM might have led to the lowest available N in soil."

    "section": "1 Introduction",
    "text": "1 Introduction\nIn the post-globalization era, many countries witnessed high momentum in economic growth. However, this rapid growth failed to provide the much-needed ‘trickle-down’ effect at the expected rate. The unequal growth of different sectors exacerbated poverty and income inequality. Generally, poor people adopt various livelihood strategies such as smallholder entrepreneurship, participation in agricultural and non-farm labour markets, and migration to overcome poverty (World Bank 2007). The decision to adopt particular strategies is influenced by access to resources and gender power relations within the community and household.\nIn recent decades, the Indian agriculture sector has experienced a high level of feminization, accelerating rapidly. The poverty-induced shift of the male population from farm to non-farm activities for sustenance and better income is quite evident in the country’s economy (Itishree et al. 2018). Therefore, providing credit and other input facilities to women is considered an important policy intervention for poverty alleviation and agricultural development in the country.\nFinancial inclusion—bringing all sections of society, regardless of socio-economic status, into the formal financial system—plays a pivotal role in any nation’s holistic development. The inclusion of marginalized sections of society in formal financial institutions is a critical prerequisite for eradicating poverty and fostering economic growth (Demirguc-Kunt, Levine, and Detragiache 2008; Rangarajan 2008). Various studies have pointed out that countries with higher levels of financial inclusion exhibit better GDP growth rates (Demirguc-Kunt and Levine 2009).\nThe microfinance movement has played a crucial role in addressing this national issue and has emerged as the single largest saviour of the rural poor from financial exclusion, especially for women. Among the different models, the Self-Help Group (SHG)-led microfinance model has evolved into the most prominent channel for financial inclusion and has become an integral and inevitable component of the rural economy in India (Dhar 2016). Ideally, poor people can invest small amounts in micro-enterprises to generate income for their livelihood. SHGs have been financing both income-generating and consumption-related needs of members. However, various studies have shown that earlier credit requirements were often used for consumption purposes (Sooryamoorthy 2007; Vasantha 2014).\nAmong income-generating activities, dairy enterprises are especially popular among farmers due to their familiarity with dairying and the opportunity for year-round cash flow, which facilitates easy loan repayment. The performance of SHGs in southern Indian states has been commendable in terms of loan repayment rates and the velocity of lending. In particular, the SHG movement in Kerala has gained significant attention due to its active role in the state’s poverty eradication programmes. A study on women’s participation in agriculture and allied activities found that over 95% of the work in the animal husbandry sector in rural Kerala was performed by women (Geethakutty et al. 2014). Furthermore, refinancing of dairy loans shows a positive trend and holds vast potential for enhancing the employment and income of poor households, especially women (NABARD 2019).\nThe factors affecting the repayment performance of SHGs require thorough investigation, as they depend on multiple socioeconomic variables. Since only a limited number of empirical studies have examined the influence of such factors in India, this paper explores the group performance of SHGs and investigates the determinants of their repayment behaviour."

    "text": "2 Materials and methods\nThe SHG movement in the study state, Kerala, began with the Kudumbashree Mission, which was implemented two decades ago with strong support from the state government. This study made use of both primary and secondary data. The secondary data regarding the dairy based SHG’s were collected from the State Poverty Eradication Mission of the Government of Kerala and also from its district offices. The primary data were collected from both SHG members and non-members during the period 2020–21.\nIn accordance with the objectives, a multistage random sampling technique was adopted. The high-altitude agro-economic zone was purposively selected due to the presence of a large number of dairy-financed SHGs in the area. From this zone, Idukki and Wayanad districts were selected purposively, as they are predominantly rural and host the highest number of dairy-financed SHGs.\nFurther, two blocks each were randomly selected from these districts: Nedumkandam and Adimaly from Idukki, and Mananthavady and Kalpetta from Wayanad. Only groups that had availed of dairy loans and had a minimum of three years of experience were included in the sample, based on the assumption that benefits of SHG participation would be meaningfully reflected over that time. From each selected block, 20 women SHGs were randomly chosen, resulting in a total sample of 80 groups.\nData on group performance—such as frequency of meetings, planned savings, transaction costs incurred, savings accumulated, interest rate charged, bank linkage loans availed, repayment schedule, income-generating activities financed, group size, financial inclusion status, and socio-economic profile of members—were collected through interviews with SHG leaders and inspection of register books.\nLoan performance was assessed using both internal and external loan indicators, considering the average of the past two years. Intragroup lending performance was measured by the percentage of members who received internal loans annually. Repayment performance was assessed by the ratio of the amount repaid to the amount due (credit plus interest), separately for internal group loans (from group savings) and external bank linkage loans (from formal financial institutions).\nThe key performance indicators were calculated as follows:\n\\[\\text{Saving performance} = \\frac{\\text{Actual Savings}}{\\text{Planned Savings}} \\tag{1}\\]\n\\[\\text{Repayment rate} = \\frac{\\text{Amount Repaid}}{\\text{Credit} + \\text{Interest}} \\tag{2}\\]\nThe delinquency rate was used as a proxy for repayment performance and was computed using Equation 3.\n\\[\\text{Delinquency rate} = \\frac{\\text{Volume of Loans in Arrears}}{\\text{Total Loan Volume on Promised Date}} \\tag{3}\\]\nA delinquency rate of 0 indicates complete repayment on schedule, while a value of 1 indicates complete delinquency. This measure follows the approach suggested by (Sharma and Zeller 1997) and (Feroze et al. 2011).\nThe factors affecting the delinquency rate were estimated using the Tobit maximum likelihood estimation technique, considering the censored nature of the dependent variable.\n\n2.1 Tobit Model Specification\nTOBIT maximum likelihood technique: The function for delinquency rate was defined as in Equation 4\n\\[\\text{DELQR} = f(\\text{LAMNT}, X) \\tag{4}\\]\n\\(\\text{LAMNT}\\) is the amount of loan in rupees and \\(X\\) is vector for group and community variables . The function is defined for \\(\\text{LAMNT}&gt;0\\). The assumption is as shown in Equation 5 \\[\\lim_{\\text{LAMNT} \\to 0} \\text{DELQR} = 0  \\tag{5}\\]\nSince defaults of small loan are likely to be zero. Hence, the dependent variable is truncated to zero when the group is having prompt repayment. The equation is specified as in Equation 6.\n\\[\\text{DELQR}_i^* = \\beta_1 + + \\beta_2 X_{2i} +  \\varepsilon_i \\tag{6}\\]\n\\[\\text{DELQR}_i =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\text{DELQR}_i^*, & \\text{if } \\text{DELQR}_i^* &gt; 0 \\\\\n0, & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\\]\n\\(\\text{DELQR}_i^*\\) is a latent variable observable when it takes a positive value.\nEquation 6 was estimated using the maximum likelihood technique (Maddala 1983). The explanatory variables used in the TOBIT model are listed in Table 1 along with its expected sign.\n\n\n\nTable 1: Measurement and expected signs of explanatory variables used in the Tobit regression model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplanatory Variable\nMeasurement\nExpected Sign\n\n\n\n\nPeer Monitoring (PM)\nFrequency of meetings per year\n–\n\n\nPeer Pressure (PP)\nPP = 1 if group members exert pressure in case of default; 0 otherwise\n±\n\n\nDegree of Self Selection (SS)\nScale measuring SS in terms of ex-ante and ex-post member selection\n–\n\n\nHomogeneity / Social Ties (HOMO)\nScale measuring group homogeneity by age, religion, marital status, education, occupation, and landholding size\n±\n\n\nGroup Size (GS)\nNumber of group members\n–\n\n\nDependency Ratio (DR)\nProportion of children in total household size\n+\n\n\nLoan Amount Limit (LONAM)\nMaximum individual loan lending limit in ₹\n+\n\n\nWorking Experience (WEXP)\nAge of the group in months\n–"

    "text": "3 Results\nThe studies pointed out that the tenure of group establishment had a significant role in the group’s overall performance (APMAS 2017; Satyasai, Sahoo, and Smita 2014). Hence, the total of 80 groups was post-classified based on their years of operation into three categories using the cumulative square root frequency method (Table 2). As per this criterion, the number of groups falling under IMG (4–8 years), MMG (9–13 years), and LMG (&gt;13 years) categories was 30 (37.50%), 28 (35.00%), and 22 (27.50%), respectively.\n\n\n\nTable 2: Classification of SHGs based on the tenure of establishment (Figures in parentheses indicate the percentage of the total number of groups)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory\nIdukki District\nWayanad District\nOverall\n\n\n\n\nInitial Matured Groups (IMG) (4–8 yrs)\n13 (32.50)\n17 (42.50)\n30 (37.50)\n\n\nMedium Matured Groups (MMG) (9–13 yrs)\n14 (35.00)\n14 (35.00)\n28 (35.00)\n\n\nLong Matured Groups (LMG) (&gt;13 yrs)\n13 (32.50)\n9 (22.50)\n22 (27.50)\n\n\nOverall\n40 (100.00)\n40 (100.00)\n80 (100.00)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe saving performance of groups was evaluated by comparing the planned savings amount with the actual savings amount. The pre-decided/agreed amount of savings in respective groups was considered as planned savings amount. The details of category wise saving performance are elaborated in Table 3. From Table 3, it is well observable that average cumulative savings per member was Rs.19803 in the overall category and it varied from Rs.13161 of IMG category to Rs. 26040 of the LMG category. The average planned savings per group was worked out as Rs. 306812 over the years and the average achievement in the targeted amount was found to be Rs.295593. The savings performance ratio in the overall category was found to be 0.9665, which implies that 96.65 per cent achievement in the pre-planned amount. The high saving ratio of the selected SHGs showed a better level of financial decorum maintained by the groups in savings amount accumulation. The improved economic background of the state and livelihood options provided through microfinance activities could be the possible reason for the high saving performance in the study area. In contrast, the saving ratio reported by the other studies was quite low and it ranges from 71 per cent to 74 per cent only (Verhelle and Berlage 2003; Feroze and Chauhan 2010). The detailed analysis across different age group categories showed that the saving performance of initial matured groups (98.11%) was relatively higher than the elder category groups. The divergence in the savings amount was observed in some groups mainly because of the adjustments of group savings to the outstanding loan arrears. The trend was observed more in elder category groups than younger ones. Such undesirable practices may affect the self-sustainability of groups in the long run.\n\n\n\nTable 3: Saving performance of SHGs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticulars\nIMG\nMMG\nLMG\nOverall\n\n\n\n\n1.

Even though the external bank linkage loan was taken in the name of generating productive purposes, its utilization was found to be diverted from the intended objectives. The utilization of external bank linkage loans across different portfolios is detailed in Table 4. It could be seen from Table 4 that 24.85 per cent of the availed loan was utilized for agricultural and allied activities and 10.58 per cent for the business purposes. The remaining 64.57 per cent of the loan availed was utilized for different consumption purposes. Among that loans, the maximum proportion of the loan was availed for meeting the requirements of children’s education (19.90%) followed by medical expenses (16.12%), household expenses (14.36%), and marriage and festival expenses (8.31%), respectively. The observations of the study found consistent with the findings of (Kumar 2013), in which he reported that 70 per cent of the availed SHG loan was utilized for personal consumption purposes rather than financing income generation activities in Kerala.\n\n\n\nTable 4: Purpose of internal loan taken\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSl.

On average, groups were capable of disbursing internal loans amounting to Rs. 370099 per annum in the study area. Among them, the long-matured groups’ loan magnitude was distinctly high, at Rs. 465506 per annum, due to the larger corpus fund availability. The tenure of establishment also influenced the magnitude of loan per member, which varied from Rs. 18100 to Rs. 31123 across different age group categories, with an overall average of Rs. 24844 per annum. The outreach of internal loans was found to be 95.24 per cent in the initially matured groups and increased to 99.32 per cent in elder (LMG) groups, with an overall average of 97.32 per cent. The analysis of internal loaning performance implies that the groups in the area were able to distribute their thrift money in a well-equitable manner.\nThe SHGs were availing loans from formal financial institutions to meet members’ extra financial requirements. The grading of groups was a mandatory criterion followed by the banks for the approval of bank linkage loans. The loan application from each group went through a three-level monitoring mechanism of the Kudumbashree Mission—namely, the Area Development Societies (ADS) committee at the panchayat ward level and the Community Development Society (CDS) committee at the panchayat level—for scrutiny. A recommendation letter from the CDS chairperson was a mandatory document for availing the bank linkage loan for SHGs. Such high-level scrutiny also helped banks assess the repayment capacity of each group.\nThe bank charged compound interest as per prevailing lending norms, which ranged from 11 to 13 per cent, based on the loan amount and the repayment duration chosen by the group. However, the groups were eligible for an interest subsidy of up to 7 per cent under the National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) interest subvention scheme. An additional 3 per cent interest subvention was provided by the state government to all Women SHGs (WSHGs) in the state.\nThe study observed that out of the total 80 groups, 4 groups (5%) had not availed any kind of bank credit in the past two years. The lack of consensus among members and risk-averse behaviour of these groups was reported as the reason, despite all groups having accessed at least one bank linkage since their inception. A maximum of eight linkages was observed among the selected SHGs. The processing time for loan applications was reported to be less than one month in the study area, and the repayment period of term loans varied from 3 to 5 years, depending on the loan amount.\n\n\n\nTable 5: Loaning performance of SHGs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticulars\nIMG\nMMG\nLMG\nOverall\n\n\n\n\nInternal loaning performance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

The recently formed groups have a lesser amount of thrift and a huge demand for working capital, which could be the possible reason for the higher credit-thrift ratio in the IMG category. The credit–thrift ratio of SHG linkage loans reported by different studies varied from 1.4:1 to 6:1 (Satyasai, Sahoo, and Smita 2014; Verhelle and Berlage 2003; Feroze and Chauhan 2010). The ratio in the elder groups was not found impressive; this was due to the ceiling on lending (Rs. 10 lakhs/group) fixed by the banks and also possibly due to the availability of high corpus funds with these groups.\nThe repayment period of internal loans varied from three months to two years in the selected SHGs. The interest rate of the internal loan has been decided as per the groups’ consensus and is being collected monthly. In the study area, the groups were charging 12 per cent simple interest for the internal group loan, i.e., 1 per cent per month. The demand for internal loans is high because of ease of availability, flexibility in the repayment schedule, and attractiveness in the interest rate. The maximum individual lending limit of the internal loan is updated based on the corpus fund availability and members’ demand. It was observed that the maximum lending limit of the internal loan amount ranged from Rs. 20000 to Rs. 75000 per member in the selected groups.\n\n\n\nTable 6: Loan repayment performance and Savings Bank Account Penetration (SBAP) of SHGs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticulars\nIMG\nMMG\nLMG\nOverall\n\n\n\n\na) Internal loan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

Although the SHGs nominally fixed the installment amount for monthly repayments, in practice, members repay their loans without any fixed installment schedule. The average repayment rate (Table 6) of the internal loan was found to be 87.81 per cent, 87.16 per cent, and 84.62 per cent in initial, medium, and long matured category groups, respectively, with an overall average of 86.72 per cent. The category-wise analysis indicated that the delinquency rate was high in the case of the LMG category compared to the younger groups. These findings were in line with the observations of (Nedumaran, Palanisami, and Swaminathan 2001; Feroze et al. 2011; APMAS 2017), where they reported that repayment of internal group loans faces more challenges than repayment of external bank linkage loans. The utilization of loans for consumption purposes and flexibility in the loan repayment might be the plausible reason for the poor repayment rate of internal group loans in the study area. Besides that, the monitoring agencies of the SHGs were more concerned about the prompt repayment of the external loan amount and least bothered about the overall repayment scenario of the groups.\nThe SHGs have been keeping separate accounts for external bank linkage loans. It was observed that the groups in the study area were not charging any extra commission for the external bank linkage loan from its members. The availed bank loan amount has been distributed within the group as per the members’ requirement. The disbursed amount varied from Rs. 15000 to Rs. 100000 per member in the sampled SHGs as per the members’ requirements. The analysis of external loan repayment revealed that the repayment rate of the bank linkage loan was quite impressive in the sampled SHGs, with an overall average of 99.24 per cent. Out of the total 80 SHGs, only 7 SHGs were facing some level of challenges in the prompt loan repayment. The groups were eligible for the back-end subsidy for prompt loan repayment, which motivates the members for timely repayment. Moreover, the banks were more stringent in penalizing defaulters, which increases the burden on all the members and automatically creates peer pressure.\nThe opening of individual savings bank accounts has been considered a prerequisite for the economic empowerment of women (Satyasai, Sahoo, and Smita 2014). The role of SHGs in the financial inclusion of members was also captured through the savings bank account penetration ratio (SBAP), i.e., the proportion of members having an individual savings bank account to the total. On average, more than 90 per cent of the group members had their own individual savings bank account in the selected SHGs. The highest SBAP ratio was observed in the LMG (96.04%) category, followed by MMG and IMG category groups. The financial literacy earned through SHG activities motivates the members to open individual bank accounts in large numbers.\n\n3.1 Determinants of Repayment Performance of SHGs\nPrompt loan repayment is an imperative factor that determines the financial sustainability of any microfinance initiatives. From the earlier economic performance analysis, it was observed that the repayment of the external bank linkage loans was quite impressive in the study area. However, the prompt repayment of internal loans lacking momentum. Thus, the factors affecting the repayment behaviour of internal group loans have captured through TOBIT censored regression model to identify the determinants of prompt loan repayment by taking the delinquency rate as a dependent variable. The sample mean of the different explanatory variables used in the model is detailed in Table 7. The average delinquency rate was worked out to be 13.28 per cent and varied from zero (complete repayment) to 24.20 per cent in the selected SHGs.\n\n\n\nTable 7: The sample means of different variables used in the Tobit model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nUnit\nMean\nMin\nMax\n\n\n\n\nA) Dependent variable\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelinquency rate\nRatio\n0.1328\n0\n0.2420\n\n\nB) Explanatory variables\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeer monitoring\nNumber\n49.28\n44\n52\n\n\nPeer pressure\nDummy (0/1)\n0.46\n0\n1\n\n\nDegree of Self-selection\nSum of scores\n2.18\n1\n4\n\n\nHomogeneity\nSum of scores\n3.60\n2\n5\n\n\nGroup size\nNumber\n15.16\n11\n20\n\n\nMean dependency ratio\nRatio\n1.84\n1.16\n2.35\n\n\nLoan amount per annum\n1,000 rupees\n43.36\n20\n75\n\n\nAge of SHG\nMonths\n127.65\n40\n228\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proper monitoring mechanism reduces the incidence of wilful default and enhances the group’s ability to collect debt in time. The number of group meetings held per annum was taken as a proxy for capturing the groups’ monitoring ability. Group meetings provide an opportunity to monitor the repayment performance of its members. In general, meetings were convened in members’ homes on a rotation basis. The average number of meetings conducted per annum was found to be 49.28 in the study area and ranged from 44 to 52 meetings per annum.\nThe variable peer pressure was captured through a dummy variable. It was observed that only 37 groups (46.25%) were exerting such kind of pressure on the group members for prompt loan repayment. Further, the self-selected groups have better understandings of their members, and the study assumed that it may lead to prompt loan repayment. The main screening of members occurred in the post group formation period. Therefore, both ex-ante and ex-post factors were considered for measuring the degree of self-selection (Wydick 1999).\nThe intensity of self-selection was captured through the scale developing technique. It was set as a four-digit scale where each positive answer gets one point to assess the intensity of self-selection. The sum of four different indicators—whether groups were formed by voluntary consensus of all the members, whether members were dropped out on group law violations, whether groups explicitly decided to reject new applicants, and whether new members had joined in the post-inception period—were considered for scale development (Verhelle and Berlage 2003; Feroze et al. 2011).\nOut of the total 80 SHGs, 74 groups (92.50%) reported that they formed the group voluntarily without any external agency involvement. The number of groups that rejected the request of a new applicant was found to be 23 (28.75%), and 68 groups (85.00%) added new members even after the inception of the group. Only 9 groups (11.25%) reported member exclusion for violating the decorum of the group. The reasons for exclusion varied from poor attendance in group meetings to non-deposit of weekly savings contributions. The average self-selection score in the selected SHGs was found to be 2.18.\nThe homogeneity in the group was measured by considering different socio-economic characteristics of group members. The scale consists of six indicators: age, religion, education, occupation, landholding size, and marital status. One point was given for each of the following: whether the age range of members was less than 15 years, whether 80% of members belonged to the same religion, had the same marital status, same educational level, same income-earning activity, and similar landholding sizes (Verhelle and Berlage 2003).\nThe highest number of groups (71 SHGs) were homogeneous in marital status (87.5%). A total of 39 groups (48.75%) reported age difference among members within 15 years, and 42 groups (52.50%) reported homogeneity in educational status. About 50 groups (62.5%) reported homogeneity in occupational status, and 63 groups (78.75%) were homogeneous in landholding size. The lowest homogeneity was observed in religion, where only 15 groups (18.75%) were homogeneous. The homogeneity score in the selected groups varied from 2 to 5, with an average of 3.6.\nSmaller groups tend to have better in-group coordination and control, reducing problems from asymmetric information (Ghatak and Guinnane 1999). Thus, it was expected that smaller group size would lead to lower default. The number of members in the selected SHGs ranged from 11 to 20, with an average of 15.16 members.\nThe average number of children directly dependent on the group members was also considered to analyze its role in repayment. The mean dependency ratio was 1.84 and ranged from 1.16 to 2.35 children per member per group.\nGroups fixed a maximum individual loan lending limit based on consensus. A higher loan limit may increase the likelihood of unwilling default. The individual loan limit was used as a proxy for this factor. It varied from Rs.20,000 to Rs.75,000 per member, with an overall average of Rs.43,360.\nThe tenure of group establishment was considered to analyze the role of experience in repayment. Older groups may better understand the repayment capacity of members based on past experience. The average group age was 127 months, ranging from 40 to 228 months in the selected SHGs.\n\n\n3.2 Estimated TOBIT Model\nThe estimated coefficients can alternatively be interpreted as the determinants of prompt loan repayment. From the estimated model (Table 8), it was found that peer pressure, homogeneity of the group, mean dependency ratio, and the amount of loan disbursed were the key factors influencing prompt loan repayment in the study area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nCoefficient\nStd.

This implies that the homogeneity of the groups raises the chance for wilful default. In socially homogeneous groups, individuals strongly rely on the peer’s unconditional support and are thus more likely to ride free, which causes prolonged time for loan repayment.\nAs expected, peer pressure had a negative association with the delinquency rate. The groups that exerted pressure on their members by implementing strict rules and penalties for late repayment demonstrated better repayment performance.\nThe coefficient of the loan amount was found to be positive and significant at the 5 per cent level. The majority of members depended on agriculture and allied activities for their livelihood and followed a ‘balloon repayment schedule’ in the study area. The pronounced seasonality of farming income compelled members to delay timely repayment of internal loans, which were less penalized compared to external bank loans. Similar observations were made by (Khandker, Samad, and Badruddoza 2017) from their Bangladesh-based study on microfinance institutions.\nThe coefficient of dependency ratio was found to be negative and significant in the estimated model. Groups with a higher dependency ratio showed better loan repayment performance, which contradicts earlier expectations.\nEven though the other variables were not statistically significant, they exhibited interesting relationships with the delinquency rate. The coefficient of peer monitoring was negative, indicating that a higher number of meetings per year has a positive influence on prompt loan repayment.\nContrary to prior assumptions, the group size variable turned negative, indicating that larger groups had better repayment rates than smaller groups. The positive coefficient of the degree of self-selection suggests that groups with a high degree of self-selection were more prone to wilful default.\nLastly, the positive coefficient of group establishment tenure indicates that the tendency for delayed repayment was higher among elder groups compared to younger ones. Elder groups were more lenient with their repayment schedules, and many did not impose penalties for irregular payments, which eventually contributed to higher delinquency."

    "text": "Discussion\nThe study provides insights into the financial behaviour of dairy-based SHGs in Kerala, with specific focus on internal loan repayment performance and its determinants. The overall loaning performance showed encouraging trends, particularly with respect to the external bank linkage loans, which recorded a high repayment rate of 99.24 per cent. In contrast, internal loans exhibited relatively lower repayment rates, with an average of 86.72 per cent, highlighting a crucial area for improvement. The Tobit regression analysis identified peer pressure, group homogeneity, dependency ratio, and loan amount as significant predictors of delinquency. Peer pressure had a significant negative relationship with delinquency, reinforcing the notion that groups which enforce rules and repayment discipline are more successful in maintaining financial decorum. Interestingly, homogeneity showed a positive and significant effect on delinquency, which contradicts conventional expectations. This suggests that in highly homogeneous groups, social closeness may undermine financial accountability due to overreliance on peer leniency. A similar counterintuitive result was observed with the dependency ratio, where groups with more dependents showed better repayment rates—possibly due to heightened financial responsibility and urgency among members with larger families.\nThe positive association of loan amount with delinquency reflects the challenges of repayment under seasonal income patterns common in agriculture. Members following balloon repayment schedules were often unable to meet instalments on time, especially in the absence of strong penalties for internal loans. Although other factors like peer monitoring, group size, and selfselection were not statistically significant, their coefficients indicated meaningful directions: more frequent meetings and larger group size were associated with lower delinquency, while greater self-selection surprisingly hinted at more wilful default. Overall, the findings highlight that internal governance, socio-economic dynamics, and institutional design within SHGs substantially influence repayment behaviour. Strengthening peer accountability, revisiting group norms on loan penalties, and promoting financial literacy can enhance the sustainability of internal lending systems within SHGs."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThe present study demonstrates that SHG-based microfinance has the potential to mobilize small savings from poor households while serving as an effective tool for the financial inclusion of women. The saving performance of the groups and the repayment of external bank linkage loans were found to be highly satisfactory in the study area. The integration of dairy activities—known for their ability to provide year-round income—has further supported the members in actively participating in microfinance initiatives. It was observed that a significant portion of group loans was utilized for consumption purposes, particularly for children’s education and medical expenses. Despite this, the repayment performance of external bank loans remained strong, indicating the effective functioning of dairy-based SHGs in rural areas. These groups have played a critical role in enhancing the economic resilience of poor households, especially women, by enabling them to manage their livelihoods more sustainably. Moreover, the experience gained through SHG participation has contributed to improved financial literacy among members. The findings of the study reaffirm the role of SHGs not only as credit providers but also as catalysts for promoting inclusive finance and empowering marginalized communities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcknowledgments\n\n\n\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and the ICAR-National Dairy Research Institute (NDRI), Karnal, for facilitating this research. We also extend our sincere thanks to the participating Self-Help Groups (SHGs) and local functionaries of the Kudumbashree Mission in Kerala for their valuable cooperation and support during the field investigation. The insights and responses shared by the group members were instrumental in shaping the outcomes of this study."

    "section": "1 Introduction",
    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe yardlong bean is one of the most important leguminous vegetables in Asia. Also known as the asparagus bean, string bean, snake bean, or snake pea, it was originally cultivated in West Africa and is now widely grown throughout Southeast Asia—including Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand—where it can be cultivated year-round. In India, it has been known since Vedic times (Benchasri, Bairaman, and Nualsri 2012).\nTypically harvested while still young, the yardlong bean is consumed as a green vegetable. It is an annual plant characterized by rapid growth, especially when supported by a trellis. Both tall and short climbing types exist. A member of the Fabaceae family, the plant features twining, delicate stems with a tenacious root system. It blooms in mid-summer, producing pairs of large white or purple flowers. Once pollinated, these flowers develop into slender, dark green beans that can grow up to 12 inches in just a few days. Mature beans can reach lengths of up to three feet, turning pale green and swelling as the red or black seeds ripen.\nThe yardlong bean also contributes to soil fertility by fixing atmospheric nitrogen through nodules on its roots. It is often referred to as the “poor man’s meat” because its pods are not only rich in protein (23–32% of seed weight) but also contain essential amino acids like lysine and tryptophan, as well as significant levels of folic acid, vitamin B, and other critical micronutrients (Peyrano, Speroni, and Avanza 2016). As such, it serves as a key dietary staple for many of the poorest populations in developing countries.\nDespite its nutritional and agricultural importance, relatively little breeding work has been conducted on this crop. The development of high-yielding, stress-tolerant varieties could significantly boost its cultivation and productivity. However, as a predominantly self-pollinated crop, studies on gene action in yardlong bean remain limited. This study aims to identify gene action governing yield-related traits, which will help inform new breeding strategies to enhance crop improvement efforts."

    "text": "2 Materials and methods\nThe genetic material used in the present study consisted of hybrid (\\(F_1\\)) plants derived from three promising crosses, along with their six respective parents. The selected parental inbred lines were chosen based solely on differences in yield-related traits. Three single-cross \\(F_1\\) hybrids were developed using parents with contrasting characteristics.\nThe three most promising hybrids, based on yield performance and disease resistance from a previous study, were selected for further evaluation. The \\(F_1\\) hybrids were backcrossed to their respective parents to generate backcross (BC) generations. Simultaneously, the \\(F_1\\) hybrids were self-pollinated to produce the corresponding \\(F_2\\) populations.\nGeneration mean analysis was conducted using eighteen populations in total: the three \\(F_1\\)s, their six parents, six backcross generations, and three \\(F_2\\) populations. The experiment was laid out in a randomized block design (RBD) with three replications in the College of Agriculture, Vellayani during Summer 2004. Standard crop management practices were followed throughout the study. Observations on yield and yield-related traits were recorded from 10 plants each for the \\(F_1\\), parent, and backcross generations. For the \\(F_2\\) populations, data were collected from 30 plants per cross.\n\n2.1 Generation Mean Analysis\nThe six-parameter model developed by Hayman (Hayman 1958) was used for generation mean analysis. The four scaling tests (\\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\)) were determined according to the method suggested by Mather (Mather 1949). These different scales are computed using simple linear combinations as given in Equation 1 to Equation 4.\n\\[A = 2\\overline{B_1} - \\overline{F_1} - P_1 = 0 \\tag{1}\\]\n\\[B = 2\\overline{B_2} - \\overline{F_1} - \\overline{P_2} = 0 \\tag{2}\\]\n\\[C = 4\\overline{F_2} - 2\\overline{F_1} - \\overline{P_1} - \\overline{P_2} = 0 \\tag{3}\\]\n\\[D = 4\\overline{F_3} - 2\\overline{F_2} - \\overline{P_1} - \\overline{P_2} = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad D = 2\\overline{F_2} - \\overline{B_2} - \\overline{B_1} \\tag{4}\\]\nWhere \\(P_1\\), \\(P_2\\), \\(F_1\\), \\(F_2\\), \\(B_1\\), and \\(B_2\\) are means of different generations, respectively. The variances of the quantities \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) were calculated from the respective variances of different generations as given from Equation 5 to Equation 8.\n\\[V_A = 4V_{\\overline{B_1}} + V_{\\overline{F_1}} + V_{\\overline{P_1}} \\tag{5}\\]\n\\[V_B = 4V_{\\overline{B_2}} + V_{\\overline{F_1}} + V_{\\overline{P_2}} \\tag{6}\\]\n\\[V_C = 16V_{\\overline{F_2}} + 4V_{\\overline{F_1}} + V_{\\overline{P_1}} + V_{\\overline{P_2}} \\tag{7}\\]\n\\[V_D = 16V_{\\overline{F_3}} + 4V_{\\overline{F_2}} + V_{\\overline{P_1}} + V_{\\overline{P_2}} \\tag{8}\\]\nWhere, \\(V_{P_1}\\) is the variance of the individuals within the \\(P_1\\) family; \\(V_{\\overline{P_1}}\\) is the variance of \\({\\overline{P_1}}\\) (mean of the \\(P_1\\) family); and \\(\\overline{V_{P_1}} = \\frac{V_{P_1}}{N}\\), where \\(N\\) is the number of individuals observed in the \\(P_1\\) family.\nThe standard error of \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) is calculated by taking the square root of their respective variances. The corresponding \\(t\\) values are computed by dividing the values of \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) by their respective standard errors.\nSignificance of any of the four scales indicates the inadequacy of the additive-dominance model and the presence of epistasis. If the calculated \\(t\\) values are found to be significant, the presence of specific types of epistasis is confirmed.\nThe significance of either one or both of the \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) scales indicates the presence of all three types of digenic interaction, namely additive × additive, additive × dominance, and dominance × dominance. The significance of scale \\(C\\) indicates the presence of dominance × dominance type of non-allelic interaction, while the significance of scale \\(D\\) denotes additive × additive type of gene action. When both \\(C\\) and \\(D\\) scales are significant, it suggests the presence of both additive × additive and dominance × dominance types of gene interaction.\n\n\n2.2 Estimation of gene effects\nSignificance of any of the scales \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\) and \\(D\\) will indicate the presence of epistatic interaction or digenic interactions. Hayman and Jinks and Jones gave a 6 parameter model for the estimation of various genetic components. The six genetic parameters were estimated using Equation 9 to Equation 14.\n\\[m = \\overline{F_2} \\tag{9}\\]\n\\[d = \\overline{B_1} - \\overline{B_2} \\tag{10}\\]\n\\[h = \\overline{F_1} - 4\\overline{F_2} - \\frac{\\overline{P_1}}{2}- \\frac{\\overline{P_2}}{2} + 2\\overline{B_1} + 2\\overline{B_2} \\tag{11}\\]\n\\[i = 2\\overline{B_1} + 2\\overline{B_2} - 4\\overline{F_2} \\tag{12}\\]\n\\[j = \\overline{B_1} - \\frac{\\overline{P_1}}{2} - \\overline{B_2} + \\frac{\\overline{P_2}}{2} \\tag{13}\\]\n\\[l = \\overline{P_1} + \\overline{P_2} + 2\\overline{F_1} + 4\\overline{F_2} - 4\\overline{B_1} - 4\\overline{B_2} \\tag{14}\\]\nWhere \\(m\\) = mean; \\(d\\) = additive effect; \\(h\\) = dominance effect; \\(i\\) = additive x additive gene interaction; \\(j\\) = additive x dominance gene interaction; \\(l\\) = dominance x dominance gene interaction.\nThe variances of the six genetic parameters were calculated using Equation 15 to Equation 20\n\\[(m) = V_{\\overline{F_2}} \\tag{15}\\]\n\\[V(d) = V_{\\overline{B_1}} + V_{\\overline{B_2}} \\tag{16}\\]\n\\[V(h) = V_{\\overline{F_1}} + 16V_{\\overline{F_2}} + \\frac{V_{\\overline{P_1}}}{4} + \\frac{V_{\\overline{P_2}}}{4} + 4V_{\\overline{B_1}} + 4V_{\\overline{B_2}} \\tag{17}\\]\n\\[V(i) = 4V_{\\overline{B_1}} + 4V_{\\overline{B_2}} + 16V_{\\overline{F_2}} \\tag{18}\\]\n\\[V(j) = V_{\\overline{B_1}} + \\frac{V_{\\overline{P_1}}}{4} + V_{\\overline{B_2}} + \\frac{V_{\\overline{P_2}}}{4} \\tag{19}\\]\n\\[V(l) = 4V_{\\overline{P_1}} + 4V_{\\overline{P_2}} + 4V_{\\overline{F_1}} + 16V_{\\overline{F_2}} + 16V_{\\overline{B_1}} + 16V_{\\overline{B_2}} \\tag{20}\\]"

    "text": "3 Results\nGeneration mean analysis is a statistical technique used to estimate the components of variance and determine the predominant type of gene action controlling important traits in a crop species. This analysis assists in selecting appropriate breeding strategies for the improvement of various quantitative traits.\nGeneration mean analysis was conducted for three cowpea crosses:\n\nCross 1: VS86 × VS132\n\nCross 2: Kozhicode Local-2 × Thiruvananthapuram Local-12\n\nCross 3: Thiruvananthapuram Local-9 × Thiruvananthapuram Local-12\n\nThe mean values of the six generations (\\(P_1\\), \\(P_2\\), \\(F_1\\), \\(F_2\\), \\(B_1\\), and \\(B_2\\)) for each cross are presented in Table 1. Among them, the \\(F_1\\) of Cross 3 flowered the earliest (38.4 days), while Cross 1 was harvested the earliest (58.1 days). The \\(F_1\\) of Cross 2 exhibited the highest pod yield per plant (454.91 g), whereas the \\(B_2\\) generation of Cross 1 recorded the maximum yield overall (485.67 g).\nThe scale values and genetic component estimates for the various traits across the three crosses are shown in Table 2 and Table 3. The estimated mean effect (\\(m\\)) was highly significant for traits such as days to flowering, pod length, pod breadth, pods per plant, pod yield per plant, and root weight across all crosses, indicating that these traits are quantitatively inherited.\nAs shown in Table 3, significant negative dominant effects (\\(h\\)) were observed for pod length and pod yield per plant, suggesting that these traits are more prominently expressed in homozygous individuals.\n\n\n\nTable 1: Generation mean values of the three crosses in yardlong

    "text": "Discussion\nThe significance of scales \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) for most traits indicates that the simple additive-dominance model is inadequate for explaining their inheritance, as reported by Thakare et al. (2016) and Kudiabor et al. (2023). Non-allelic interactions, alongside additive and dominance components, were observed in the expression of several traits, similar to the findings of Edematie et al. (2021) and Akombo et al. (2021).\nSignificant additive × additive (\\(i\\)) interactions were found for pod length, pods per plant, pod yield per plant, and root weight, suggesting complementary or duplicate epistasis. Non-allelic interactions were also evident in traits like days to first flowering. Here, additive effects were highly significant, and additive × dominance (\\(j\\)) interactions were also observed. Dominance × dominance (\\(l\\)) interactions acted in a favorable negative direction in all hybrids. Similar epistatic interactions for early flowering and duplicate epistasis for traits like days to 90% pod maturity in cowpea were reported by Patel et al. (2013), Thakare et al. (2016), and Owusu et al. (2022).\nThese findings imply that earliness in cowpea could be improved through hybridization followed by the selection of promising recombinants in later generations, particularly in crosses governed by duplicate epistasis.\nThe significance of scales \\(C\\) and \\(D\\) for pod length further supports the involvement of dominance × dominance and additive × additive interactions in this trait. Significant additive (\\(d\\)) and dominance (\\(h\\)) effects for pod length were also reported by Rashwan (2010) and Thakare et al. (2013).\nAmong epistatic interactions, dominance × dominance (\\(l\\)), additive × additive (\\(i\\)), and additive × dominance (\\(j\\)) were observed in different crosses. In the case of pod weight, both dominance effects and additive × additive interactions were significant but acted in a negative direction. However, the positive significance of dominance × dominance interactions suggests that hybridization followed by selection would be an effective strategy for improving this trait.\nAll three types of digenic interactions (\\(i\\), \\(j\\), \\(l\\)) were observed for pods per plant. While additive × dominance (\\(j\\)) was positive and significant, both dominance (\\(h\\)) and additive × additive (\\(i\\)) effects acted in the negative direction. The presence of non-allelic interactions for this trait aligns with the findings of Thakare et al. (2016) and Edematie et al. (2021). Significant positive dominance (\\(h\\)) and dominance × dominance (\\(l\\)) interactions suggest the presence of complementary epistasis. In contrast, the negative significance of dominance × dominance (\\(l\\)) for pod yield per plant implies limited potential for improvement through heterosis breeding for this trait.\nThe direction of dominance and dominance × dominance interactions indicated duplicate gene action in the expression of traits such as pod weight, pod breadth, pods per cluster, seeds per pod, root weight per plant, and days to first harvest. Dominance was found to play a role in all traits, especially pod length, as reported by Santos et al. (2024) and Pallavi, Singh, and Chaudhary (2019).\nBoth additive × additive and dominance × dominance interactions were significant for root weight per plant, while the insignificance of all four scale tests (\\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), \\(D\\)) for traits like pod breadth, pods per cluster, seeds per pod, days to first harvest, primary branches per plant, and 100-seed weight indicates the adequacy of the additive-dominance model for these traits, and the absence of epistasis. Nonetheless, duplicate epistasis for most yield-related traits in cowpea was previously reported by Shinde et al. (2021)."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThe generation mean analysis conducted on three cowpea crosses revealed complex genetic control for several important agronomic traits. While the mean effect was highly significant for all key traits, indicating their quantitative nature, the inadequacy of the simple additive-dominance model—evidenced by significant scale tests and the presence of epistasis—highlights the role of non-allelic gene interactions in trait inheritance. Additive × additive, additive × dominance, and dominance × dominance interactions were frequently observed across traits such as pod length, pod yield per plant, pods per plant, and root weight. The predominance of duplicate and complementary epistasis suggests that hybridization followed by selection in segregating generations would be an effective breeding strategy for improving these traits.\nTraits like pod breadth, seeds per pod, and 100-seed weight showed no significant epistasis, indicating that selection based on the additive-dominance model may suffice for their improvement. Conversely, traits influenced by significant non-additive gene actions, such as pod yield and pod weight, may benefit more from recombination breeding approaches. Overall, this study underscores the importance of understanding the underlying gene action for designing appropriate breeding strategies. The insights gained provide a valuable foundation for improving yield and related traits in cowpea through targeted hybridization and selection efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcknowledgments\n\n\n\nThe first author gratefully acknowledges the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Government of India, for awarding the Junior Research Fellowship (JRF) in support of the Ph.D. programme."

    "text": "1 Introduction\nEvery step taken towards reduction in postharvest loss has a direct relation to nutritional and sensory quality (Ziv and Fallik 2021). Sensory quality plays an important role in consumer acceptance of a product or produce. Sensory evaluation is an information-gathering process and a multidisciplinary science, including food science, psychology, statistics, and home economics, which measures, analyses, and interprets humans’ behavioural responses to different products based on the five senses of sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch. This helps in understanding consumer preferences (Sharif et al. 2017; Stone, Bleibaum, and Thomas 2020; Yu, Low, and Zhou 2018). Sensory experiments are controlled scientific studies conducted to understand sensory preferences by human panels. This article covers the different experimental designs, analysis methods, and software packages used in sensory studies, whose understanding helps in conducting proper sensory analysis.\nIn order to conduct a sensory experiment, an objective should be formulated. Depending on the objectives there are different methods for sensory evaluation such as affective test, discrimination test, descriptive test and quality test. Different situations in which the tests can be adopted has been shown below in Table 1.\n\n\n\nTable 1: Situations where different tests are used\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest\nWhat can be studied\nMeasures that can be used\n\n\n\n\nAffective tests\nSubjective attitudes, such as product acceptance and preference\nnine-point hedonic scale (Moskowitz and Sidel 1971)\n\n\nDiscrimination test\nWhether samples are detectably different from one another\nDuo-Trio and Triangular method (Bi 2015)\n\n\nDescriptive tests\nSensory properties of products: perceived intensity of those properties (Lawless and Heymann 2010)\nQuantitative Descriptive Analysis (QDA): attributes are quantified using numerical scales Sensory profiling: textural or flavour characteristics are described using words or intensity scales (Lawless and Heymann 2010; Risvik et al. 1994) Free Choice Profiling (FCP): panelists can use their own words or use predefined words, but they have to use their words consistently throughout the experiment (Punter 2018)\n\n\nQuality tests\nproduct’s proximity to a standard\nProjective maps: panelists would arrange products on a paper based on the products’ similarities or dissimilarities (Risvik et al. 1994)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince human panels are involved, there are chances of occurrence of several errors. Designing of experiments is important for the proper conduct of these tests. It is a critically important tool for improving the product realisation process. Design provides structure and ease for carrying out experiments and provides useful outcomes (Montgomery 2017; Ruiz-Capillas and Herrero 2021; Ruiz-Capillas et al. 2021). The use of the right statistical design and analysis procedure is very much essential for proper product development. A comprehensive review of the existing designs and their applications, various tests that can be adopted, as well as different software available for various tests, has been done in this paper. This will be useful for researchers working in the area of sensory experiments with less statistical background."

    "section": "2 Designs And Approaches in Sensory Experiments",
    "text": "2 Designs And Approaches in Sensory Experiments\nIn design of experiments, the objects of comparison such as the combination of ingredients or the conditions suitable for the development of a particular product, are termed as Treatments. Experimental units are the subjects or objects on which treatments are applied. In case of sensory experiments, the evaluators or the samples used for the sensory evaluation can be the experimental unit depending on the objective. Evaluators can also be called as panelists. The outcomes observed as a result of the treatment is termed as responses. Responses are also known as the dependent factors, since it is dependent on the independent factors, whose influence on a response variable is being studied in the experiment. For example, consider the study on the effect of poppy, sucrose, and citric acid on the taste, smell, colour, and general acceptance of a Turkish sherbet, as carried out by Aydoğdu, Tokatlı Demirok, and Yıkmış (2023), where poppy, sucrose, and citric acid levels were the independent variables. The taste, smell, colour, and general acceptance were the dependent variables.\nWhile designing an experiment, three basic principles are to be followed, viz. randomization, replication, and local control (blocking). Randomization ensures equal chances for each experimental unit to receive each treatment. Replication is the repetition of treatments to obtain more accurate results. In sensory experiments, blocks could be panelists or sessions (Das and Giri 1986; Gacula 2008; Jankovic, Chaudhary, and Goia 2021; Lawless and Heymann 2010; Montgomery 2017). The number of panelists is decided based on the extent of training. If the panelists are trained, only five to ten panelists would be required; 25 panelists are needed if they are semi-trained, and at least 100 panelists are required if they are untrained. Different designs are available, and one can choose their design based on the objective of the experiment (Indian Standards et al. 1971). Through this paper, we intend to discuss various designs for sensory experiments and product formulation, as well as different analysis procedures to be adopted on the data generated.\n\n2.1 Paired comparison design\nIf the objective of the experiment is to identify the effect of flavouring on liking, or to identify a preferred product between two products, paired comparison designs are used. Here, the panelists are provided with two samples, and since the evaluation is being done by the same panelists, the scores will be correlated (Gacula 2008). The null hypothesis would be that the two samples have the same effect. The objective is to select the better formulation.\n\n\n2.2 Group comparison design\nFor the comparison of two formulations based on a standard, group comparison designs are used. There must only be a small variation in scores among panelists and fairly homogeneous experimental units for the design to give better results (Gacula 2008). The null hypothesis would be that both of the formulations are similar to the standard. The objective is to identify the one which is more similar to the standard in terms of liking.\n\n\n2.3 Completely Randomised Design (CRD)\nWhen the comparison is among more than two formulations or combinations or characteristics, such as the effects of flavouring on liking, Completely Randomised Designs (CRD) are used. In CRD, treatments can be equally or unequally replicated and the experimental units are expected to be homogenous. The total number of samples would be the number of treatments × replication, and each sample would be given to the panelists (Lawless and Heymann 2010). More and Chavan (2019) had three treatments, five replications, and the total number of samples were 15. Five trained panelists evaluated all of the samples to analyse the effect of red pumpkin powder on burfi (sweet dish). The levels of red pumpkin powder were varied as 15 percent, 17 percent, and 19 percent, keeping condensed milk solids and sugar levels constant. Usually, in CRD, sensory fatigue occurs in panelists when samples are tasted continuously. To avoid that, Monadic designs are often associated with CRD. In monadic designs, panelists are divided into groups, and each group is given one treatment. In sequential monadic designs, each panellist is given all the treatments but not the replications. Monadic designs are better when the number of panelists is large (Lawless and Heymann 2010). Fatoretto et al. (2018) conducted a sequential monadic experiment and gave two samples each of dehydrated Italian and grape tomatoes to each panellist. A total of 100 samples were made for 50 panelists. Other experiments that employed CRD include (Baclayon, Cerna, and Cimafranca 2020; Suryani and Norhasanah 2016).\n\n\n2.4 Randomised Complete Block Design (RCBD)\nFor the same objective of comparison among more than two formulations, but with blocking, Randomised Complete Block Design (RCBD) can be used. Blocks could be panelists or sessions. In RCBD, every treatment must be equally replicated. In sensory experiments, with panellist as a block, all the treatments will be given in a randomised order to a panellist and then, after a small break, all treatments are given again in some other order. The number of times this process is repeated will be the number of replications. Similarly, the treatments are given to all the other blocks (Silva et al. 2014). If session is a block, each panellist will be attending each session and testing each of the samples. Sessions could be divided into periods such that each treatment appears only once in each session. The total number of sessions will be the number of replications of each treatment (Chambers, Bowers, and Dayton 1981).\n\n\n2.5 Balanced Incomplete Block Design (BIBD)\nWhen the number of treatments to be evaluated becomes larger, Balanced Incomplete Block Design (BIBD) is used. A BIBD is an arrangement of v treatments in b blocks such that there will be k(&lt;v) treatments in each block, each treatment will be repeated r times and every pair of treatments will be appearing together in λ(lambda) blocks. Here, any two blocks will have the same number of treatments, but the combinations can differ. These combinations should be arranged in such a manner that any two pairs occur the same number of times as any other pair. For example, Silva et al. (2014) employed BIBD to compare five grape juices made from different pulp concentrations for six attributes such as violet colour, grape aroma, sweetness, sourness, grape flavour, and mouthfeel. In a block, only three treatments (juices of different pulp concentrations) were taken, and there were ten blocks (sessions). Similarly, Hinneh et al. (2020) employed BIBD for sensory profiling of chocolate in their experiment. Ten attributes; cocoa, acidity, astringency, bitterness, nuttiness, woodiness, floral, fresh fruit, browned fruit and spiciness were tested. The basic design had 16 chocolates (treatments) and 16 sessions, and in each session six chocolates were test. In BIBD, the number of sessions should at least equal the number of treatments.\n\n\n2.6 Resolvable multisession sensory design\nSaurav et al. (2017) developed this design specifically, to avoid carryover effect and reduce sensory fatigue. If there are v products to be tested, and ‘v’ is a prime number or prime power this design can be used. Here the number of panelists will also be ‘v’. ‘v’ can be denoted as v= 4t+1, 6t+1, or 4t+3, where ‘t’ is the number of sessions. Sessions are divided into periods such that total number of periods should be v-1 and each period should contain all the products. Order of products in each period is randomised such that a panellist should not be testing a single product more than once. After v-1 periods, each panellist will be testing v-1 products. This design is resolvable since in all the sessions each treatment is repeated the same number of times.\n\n\n2.7 Latin Square Design (LSD)\nWakeling and MacFie (1995) detailed the use of Latin squares (Williams 1949) in sensory experiments. They specified the number of consumers needed for testing a given number of products. The all-possible-combination approach and designs based on Mutually Orthogonal Latin Squares (MOLS) were also discussed. Rodrigues et al. (2017) employed a special type of Latin square, known as the Sudoku design, in their experiment. The experiment tested 16 treatments (15 different samples and one repeat sample). A series of eight Sudoku designs were used four randomized independently and four others in the reverse order giving a 16 × 16 design. Sixteen panelists were assigned to test the 16 samples in random orders. The experiment had eight replications with different panelists, resulting in a total of 128 panelists. Here, the experimental unit was a particular order of 16 samples. Saurav et al. (2017) detailed the applications of Williams Latin Square Design (LSD), which is popular in sensory trials due to the minimization of carryover effects. As in CRD, samples can also be presented monadically within Williams LSD (Depetris Chauvin et al. 2024; Nandorfy et al. 2023).\n\n\n2.8 Factorial experiments\nWhen different levels of different factors are studied, factorial experiments are used. In full factorial experiments, in each replication, all possible combinations of all factors are investigated. If there are k factors with n levels, the total number of trials will be nk (Das and Giri 1986). Arpi et al. (2023) conducted a 2×3 factorial experiment in CRD, where one factor (concentration of cascara extract) was at two levels (20% and 25%) and the other factor (concentration of lemon extract) was at three levels (0%, 3%, and 5%). Six treatment combinations were there with three replications each. A total of 18 samples were made, and each panellist tested all these samples. Full factorial experiments result in higher costs as the number of factors and levels increases (Jankovic, Chaudhary, and Goia 2021).\n\n\n2.9 Response Surface Methodology (RSM)\nRSM is a collection of statistical and mathematical techniques used for developing new products, improving existing products, and optimising production processes. Optimisation techniques are used for the estimation of interactions among the independent variables and their quadratic effects on response variables. Optimisation experiments could be mixture experiments or non-mixture experiments, based on the independent and response variables. In a mixture experiment, the response variable is dependent on the proportions of the independent variables. When the level of one of the ingredients changes, the levels of the others will also change accordingly so that the total proportion equals 1. In non-mixture experiments, changing the level of one of the ingredients does not affect the levels of the others (Gacula 2008). Most practical applications of RSM involve more than one response (Myers, Montgomery, and Anderson-Cook 2016).\n\n\n2.10 Response surface designs\nFactor–response relationship is known as the response surface. To obtain optimum results, the treatment combinations should be carefully chosen. Designs used for statistical modelling of the optimisation of a product or process are called response surface designs. The commonly used designs are Central Composite Design (CCD), Box–Behnken Design (BBD), and Plackett–Burman Design (PBD) (Gacula 2008).\n\nPlackett-Burman Design\nThis design is popular as it allows the screening of main factors from a large number of variables that can be retained in the further optimisation process (Siala et al. 2012). It allows two levels for each control variable, similar to a two-level factorial model, and requires a much smaller number of experimental runs, making it more economical (Khuri and Mukhopadhyay 2010). Boateng and Yang (2021), in their experiment, used PBD for screening important factors affecting infrared drying.\n\n\nCentral Composite Design\nCCD has an embedded factorial design and is preferred over 3k factorial to model a quadratic relationship because it requires fewer assays to achieve better modelling. Along with the experimental points of the factorial design, CCD considers additional points known as star points or axial points and centre points. However, a CCD includes extreme points, which is not advisable for special processes such as extraction of a compound sensitive to high temperature and pressure (Gacula 2008; Myers, Montgomery, and Anderson-Cook 2016). The total number of trials for the design is F + 2v + nc, where F is the number of factorial points, v is the number of factors, and nc is the number of centre points. In their study, Nahemiah (2016) considered three factors at two levels, and axial and centre points were included to obtain values at five levels. The number of factorial points was 8, and one centre point was used; hence, the number of trials was 8 + 6 + 1 = 15. In this case, the axial level, \\(\\alpha = \\left(2^{\\,n-1}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{n}} = 1.68\\); where n is 3, the number of factors considered in the experiment. The axial point is calculated as: Centre ± [\\(\\alpha\\)× (High level − Low level) / 2]. In their study, the centre point was replicated five times, and all other runs were replicated twice. Van Linh et al. (2019) presented a 22 factorial CCD design with 13 runs, while Anisa, Solomon, and Solomon (2017) demonstrated a face-centred CCD design.\n\n\nBox Behnken Design\nIn Box–Behnken Design (BBD), only three levels are needed for each factor. It considers face points rather than axial points, as in CCD. The number of design points increases with the number of factors; hence, the number of factors for product formulation is usually limited to four when this design is used (Gacula 2008). Applying this design is popular in food processes due to its economical nature (Yolmeh and Jafari 2017). The number of trials for BBD is given by the formula N = 2v(v − 1) + nc, where v is the number of factors and nc is the number of centre points. In their study, Li et al. (2024) developed a three level three factor design, with N= 2*3(3-1) + nc = 12+nc , to improve the tensile properties, colour, and sensory quality of bran-yogurt stewing noodles. Design Expert software was used to generate the design. Here the centre point was replicated five times, resulting in a total of 17 trials."

    "text": "3 Analysis of Sensory Data\nThe common techniques used in the analysis of sensory data are discussed below. The selection of an analysis method depends on the type of data generated and the objective of the study. In CRD, RCBD, BIBD, Williams LSD, and resolvable multisession sensory designs, the experiment should generate numerical data (interval or ratio scale) (Bower 2013). In comparison designs, the data generated can be numerical (scores) or ordinal (data from different scales). Yu, Low, and Zhou (2018) comprehensively reviewed the application of regression analysis in sensory data. Some other common analyses followed are discussed in this paper.\n\n3.1 Paired t test\nFor paired and group comparison design, for significance testing, a t test can be used for analysis of the data obtained. Most preferred t test is a paired t test. It is used in situations where each panelists evaluate both the product. Let X1i be the response for first formulation by ith panellist and X2i be the response for the second formulation by the same panellist, X1i – X2i = di. di is the observed difference. It is assumed that d is distributed normally with mean \\(\\bar{d}\\) and variance σ2, Test statistic is:\n\\[t_{(n-1)} = \\frac{\\bar{d}}{\\sigma / \\sqrt{n}} \\tag{1}\\]\nWhere, \\(sd = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(d_i - \\bar{d})^2}{n - 1}}\\). Since the null hypothesis is H0: µ1 = µ2; µ = µ1 - µ2 =0. µ1 is the mean score of first product and µ2 is the mean score of second product.If the t-value is greater than the critical value from the t-distribution table, the difference is considered significant (Gacula 2008). Other variations of t-tests include the single-sample test, where a product is evaluated by panelists based on a control, and the independent t-test, where two products are evaluated by two different groups of panelists (Lawless and Heymann 2010). Rao et al. (2024), in their comparative study on guava juices, used a t-test.\n\n\n3.2 Mann-Whitney U test\nWhen the data generated are scores or ranks (ordinal data), instead of t test, its non-parametric counterpart, Mann-Whitney U test is used. Consider two samples a and b with na and nb number of scores. The scores would then be combined and ranked. Then the rank scores will be divided by groups to find Ta and Tb, sums of rank scores of a and b respectively.\n\\[U_a = T_a - \\frac{n_a(n_a + 1)}{2} \\tag{2}\\]\n\\[U_b = T_b - \\frac{n_b(n_b + 1)}{2} \\tag{3}\\]\nU is the minimum of Ua and Ub. If the value is greater than the critical value from the Mann–Whitney table, there is a significant difference (MacFarland and Yates 2016).\n\n\n3.3 Chi square test\nChi-square tests are used in the case of difference tests or discrimination tests (Nominal data) (Boggs and Hanson 1949).\n\\[\\chi^2 = \\frac{(a - rb)^2}{r(a - b)} \\tag{4}\\]\nwhere Oij and Eij are the observed and expected frequencies respectively.\n\n\n3.4 Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)\nFor designs with more than two treatments, and the data generated are normally distributed, ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) can be conducted. A normality test is recommended before proceeding with ANOVA. In ANOVA the total variation in the observed data is partitioned into different sources. Number of sources in ANOVA is dependent on the designs used. For example, in CRD the source of variation is from treatments, so one-way ANOVA is performed. And if RCBD is used, two-way ANOVA is performed where block effect is also accounted for. From ANOVA, F ratio statistic is obtained and if found significant, indicates that at least one treatment mean is significantly different from one or more treatments in the experiment. To identify the treatments that are similar, pairwise comparisons can be carried out using multiple comparison procedures. Least Significant Difference (LSD) test, Tukey’s test, and Duncan’s Multiple Range Test (DMRT) are some of the common multiple comparison tests used (Gacula 2013; Agbangba et al. 2024).\n\nLeast Significant Difference\nLSD allows for a direct comparison of two means from two different groups by calculating the smallest significance as if a test had been run on those two means. Any difference between the means greater than the LSD is considered statistically significant. If t is the critical value from the 𝑡-distribution table, MSE is the mean square error obtained from the results of the ANOVA test, and ni and nj are the number of scores used to calculate the means:\n\\[LSD = t_{(\\alpha/2, df)} \\times \\sqrt{MSE \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{n_i} + \\frac{1}{n_j}\\right)} \\tag{5}\\]\nµi and µj are the mean scores of the two groups. dij =|µi - µj|, will be calculated and when dij&gt; LSD, significance will be declared (Gacula 2013).\n\n\nDuncan’s Multiple Range Test (DMRT)\nIt is more useful than LSD when there are more number of pairs to be compared. \\[T = q_{(\\alpha/2, df, ds)} \\times \\sqrt{MSE \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{n_i} + \\frac{1}{n_j}\\right)} \\tag{6}\\]\nT is the lowest significant difference, q is the critical value from the q distribution table, ni and nj are the number of scores used to calculate the means, r is the range, or the number of means being compared, df is the error degrees of freedom and MSE is the mean square error obtained from the results of the ANOVA test. Here the sample mean will be arranged in ascending order to find the degrees of separation and T values will be calculated. If difference of mean pairs is greater than T, significant difference will be declared. As the range r increases, the critical value q and, consequently, the T value also increase. This means that, comparisons between means that are farther apart require a larger difference to be considered significant. Therefore, the values of T in DMRT differ for each range, with smaller T values for adjacent means and larger ones for more widely separated means, making the test stepwise and more precise in identifying significant differences among treatments(Gacula 2013).\n\n\nTukey’s test\nTukey’s test is designed for equal variance and group size. The critical difference to be exceeded is called the Honestly Significant Difference (HSD). If µi and µj are the means to be compared and n is the number of scores used for calculating mean\n\\[HSD = \\frac{(\\mu_i - \\mu_j)}{\\sqrt{MSE / n}} \\tag{7}\\]\nIf µi - µj&gt; HSD, there is significant difference (Gacula 2013).\nLSD is a sensitive procedure; however, it does not regulate the overall (experiment-wise) error rate. When applied to multiple pairwise comparisons, it can substantially increase the likelihood of Type I errors. In contrast, Tukey’s HSD and DMRT provides stronger protection against false positives and is therefore typically a more reliable option for comparing several means (Montgomery 2017).\n\n\n\n3.5 Kruskal-Wallis H test\nIt is the nonparametric counterpart of one-way ANOVA. Consider a, b, …, n groups, with na, nb ,…, nn scores, for Kruskal-Wallis test, the scores are combined and ranked, and the rank scores are summed by group to obtain T1, T2, …,Tn. Let Tc denote the rank sum of each sample, nc denote the number of scores for each sample and N is the total number of participants. If the H value is greater than the chi-square table value, there is a significant difference between at least one treatment pair (Kruskal and Wallis 1952).\n\\[H = \\left[ \\frac{12}{N(N + 1)} \\sum \\frac{T_c^2}{n_c} \\right] - 3(N + 1) \\tag{8}\\]\nDunn’s test can be performed as the post hoc test if the test is found significant.\n\n\n3.6 Friedman’s test\nIt is the nonparametric counterpart of two-way ANOVA, where sessions or panelists could be considered as blocks. Pereira, Afonso, and Medeiros (2015) reviewed Siegel and Castellan (1988), describing the test statistic and post hoc analysis. The data are represented with n rows and k columns. The rows represent the blocks, and the columns represent the treatments. R·k is the sum of ranks for treatment k over n blocks.\n\\[T = \\left[ \\frac{12}{nK(K + 1)} \\sum R_{.k}^2 \\right] - 3n(K + 1) \\tag{9}\\]\nWilcoxon test, Wilcoxon-Nemenyi-McDonald-Thompson test, sign test, or Dunn’s test can be considered for post hoc analysis.\n\n\n3.7 Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\nPCA is mostly used in Quantitative Descriptive Analysis (QDA) and for analysing projective maps (Valentin et al. 2012) with seven or more samples. Attributes are often removed from the analysis if they appear in lower quantities or occur fewer times (Civille and Oftedal 2012). In QDA, data can be averaged across panelists or used in raw form. Averaging simplifies the data but masks individual differences (Næs et al. 2021). A product (columns) × attribute (rows) matrix is reduced to a smaller number of independent components or factors without sacrificing the information contained in the larger dataset. Each of the original attributes is then projected onto the resulting components to interpret them. The cosine of the angle between the attribute vector and each component gives the correlation between them, and the length of the vector is proportional to the variance (Greenhoff and MacFie 1994).\n\n\n3.8 Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA)\nMultiple Factor Analysis (MFA) is a multivariate method used when the same set of individuals is described by several groups of variables. By balancing each group’s contribution, MFA creates a unified space that allows joint interpretation of all data blocks. In sensory science, it is particularly useful when products are evaluated by multiple panels or when sensory and physicochemical measurements are combined. MFA helps identify product similarities, assess agreement between groups, and determine how different variable sets contribute to product discrimination (Pagès and Husson 2014).\n\n\n3.9 Thurstonian models\nSince the discrimination tests like triangle tests, duo-trio tests etc results in binary data, Thurstonian models are used for the analysis, where the binary data are transformed to relative sensory differences (Christensen and Brockhoff 2009). It measures how well individuals can distinguish between two similar stimuli based on their internal sensory responses. It produces a value called d′ (d-prime), d′ quantifies the separation between the two internal response distributions in standard deviation units. Higher values of d′, reflects better discrimination (Lee and O’Mahony 2004). Bi and Kuesten (2024) modelled the duo trio test and its variants, deriving Thurstonian psychometric functions, comparing statistical power across formats, and providing R code for computing d′ and its variance to improve precision in sensory test sensitivity assessment.\n\n\n3.10 General Procrustean Analysis (GPA)\nIn Free Choice Profiling, each panellist is using their own words, hence the data cannot be averaged. Instead, an individual matrix is created for each panellist to compute an n-dimensional product space, and these product spaces are then averaged to form a consensus configuration. Procrustes ANOVA (PANOVA) is conducted before applying transformations. Three transformations-rotation, translation, and isotropic scaling-are then performed to align the individual configurations, minimizing differences and generating the final consensus space (Bower 2013).\n\n\n3.11 Linear Mixed Effects Model\nMixed-effects models are widely applied in sensory and consumer research because they incorporate both fixed sources of variation, such as products, and random sources, such as assessors. Their ability to account for repeated measurements, assessor variability, and assessor–product interactions enables more reliable estimation of product differences. In sensory profiling, product effects are typically treated as fixed, whereas assessors and their interactions with products are modeled as random to permit generalization beyond the specific panel (Lawless and Heymann 2010). Compared with traditional ANOVA, mixed-effects models also handle unbalanced data and missing observations more effectively. Recent advances, including automated model-selection tools proposed by (Kuznetsova et al. 2015) have further improved their practical application. Overall, these developments demonstrate the strong suitability of mixed-effects models for analyzing sensory responses under realistic experimental conditions.\n\n\n3.12 Ordinal Logistic Regression\nThe ordinal logistic regression or proportional odds model (POM), is used to analyze ordered categorical responses without assuming equal spacing between categories. It models the cumulative probability of a response being at or below each category under the assumption that predictor effects on the log-odds are constant across thresholds, known as the proportional odds assumption (Agresti 2010). This makes POM appropriate for sensory and consumer research that commonly employs ordinal rating scales. For example, (Fatoretto et al. 2018) applied POM to evaluate dehydrated tomato samples and demonstrated that processing treatments significantly increased the likelihood of higher sensory ratings. By retaining the ordinal nature of sensory scores, the POM provides a robust framework for assessing product differences in ordered sensory datasets.\n\n\n3.13 RSM Analysis\nThe mathematical model for first order and second order response surface are given below. First order response surface: \\[y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\varepsilon \\tag{10}\\]\nwhere x1,x2 are the design variables, β1, β2 are the regression coefficients. Second order response surface: \\[y = \\beta_0 + \\sum_{i=1}^{q} \\beta_i x_i + \\sum_{i=1}^{q} \\beta_{i} x_i^2 + \\sum_{i&lt;j} \\sum_{1&lt;j}\\beta_{ij} x_i x_j+ε \\tag{11}\\]\nwhere xi, xj are the design variables, β0, βi, βij are the regression coefficients, xi2 is the quadratic effect and xi, xj are the interaction effect and ε is the error associated (Myers, Montgomery, and Anderson-Cook 2016). Second order response surface models are more suited for sensory experiments since it can represent more complex relationships (Nwabueze 2010). Response surface plots are the visualisation of the effects of variables on the response. This could be two-dimensional contour maps or three-dimensional maps, providing an accurate geometric depiction. Plots are made by fitting regression model by keeping non-significant (P &gt; 0.05) variable constant and varying other variables. Optimal conditions are found out by superimposing the response surfaces (Annor et al. 2009; Nwabueze 2010; Myers, Montgomery, and Anderson-Cook 2016). Both three dimensional and contour maps are observed together for better understanding. Since the minimum or maximum point is at the centre of the design space, the contour plots will show a circle or ellipse at the centre. When the target point is neither maximum nor minimum point (saddle point), the contour plots show parabolic or hyperbolic contours (Myers, Montgomery, and Anderson-Cook 2016). The interaction among the input variables and parameters is called a design space (Bastogne 2017).

    "text": "4 Conclusion\nDesigns are adopted based on the objective of the sensory experiments. If the objective is comparison between two products, paired comparison or group comparison designs could be used. If there are more than two combinations of ingredients and one has to choose the best combination, CRD or RCBD could be used. When the number of treatments is larger, BIBD can be used. When different factors are varied in different levels to make various combinations, factorial experiments are conducted. Response surface designs are used for product optimisation. Response surface graphs helps in understanding the effects of variables on responses much easily. For pairwise and groupwise comparison designs, a t test or Mann Whitney U test can be performed for analysis. For designs with more than two treatments ANOVA or Kruskal Wallis test can be used. For analysis of nominal data chi square test or Thurstonian models are used."

    "section": "1 Introduction",
    "text": "1 Introduction\nAgroecology emerges as a promising and scientifically grounded response to the complex challenges of modern agriculture such as biodiversity loss, environmental degradation and the growing unsustainability of conventional farming systems (Valenzuela 2016). It represents a comprehensive and systems-based approach that utilizes ecological principles and concepts to guide the design, organization, and management of sustainable farming systems (FAO [Food and Agriculture Organization] 2019). It seeks to enhance the interrelationships among plants, animals, humans and the environment with the goal of achieving a balanced integration of productivity, biodiversity and overall ecosystem health (Gliessman, Engles, and Krieger 1998; Zhang et al. 2022; Vikas and Ranjan 2024). Despite its transformative potential, awareness and practical understanding of agroecological principles remain limited among many farmers and policymakers.\nIndia provides a compelling backdrop for this discussion. Across India, generations of farmers have practiced indigenous farming methods that preserve soil fertility, enhance crop diversity and reduce reliance on synthetic inputs, embodying principles of ecological balance and traditional knowledge long before the term “Agroecology” was formally recognized (Nicholls and Altieri 2018; Bisht et al. 2022).\nAmong the states in India, the Northeast region is well renowned for its rich agricultural diversity, deep-rooted cultural heritage and indigenous traditional knowledge systems (Singh 2024; Pandey, Brearley, and Ram 2024). Meghalaya, in particular, stands out due to its unique agroecological landscape, where traditional farming practices such as shifting cultivation (jhum), terrace (bun) farming and agroforestry are extensively practiced by indigenous communities (Tiwari and Pant 2018; J. Borah 2018; Tynsong 2020). These practices are integrated with local environmental conditions, promoting biodiversity conservation, soil fertility and climate resilience. Therefore, Meghalaya’s farming traditions exemplify a harmonious relationship between people and nature, making it a pivotal region for agroecological research and sustainable agricultural development. This strong cultural and ecological foundation positions Meghalaya as a “critical hub” for advancing agroecology in Northeast India and beyond.\nHowever, in the past few years, evolving socio-economic pressures, population growth and increased market integration have significantly transformed traditional agricultural systems in Meghalaya. The intensification and commercialization of farming have gradually displaced long-standing agroecological practices (Krishna 2020; Behera, Rout, and Paul 2023). As farmers adapt to new economic realities, many indigenous methods rooted in traditional knowledge are being modified or replaced by input-intensive and market-driven approaches. This transition highlights the urgent need to critically examine the current patterns, scope and determinants of agroecological adoption, to better understand how farming communities balance livelihood enhancement with environmental sustainability (Giri et al. 2020; Tyngkan et al. 2022).\nNevertheless, Meghalaya’s strong base of indigenous knowledge and traditional ecological practices, coupled with a growing interest in sustainable agriculture, presents significant potential for advancing agroecological transformation in the region (D. Borah, Rout, and Nooruddin 2024). Although Meghalaya’s traditional farming systems are well documented, there is limited empirical research examining how farmers understand and adopt agroecological principles in the context of today’s rapidly changing socio-economic environment. Most existing studies concentrate on specific indigenous practices rather than comprehensively exploring socio-economic determinants or evaluating farms through a multidimensional agroecology framework. Key constraints, including market pressures, livelihood transitions, and the erosion of traditional knowledge, remain insufficiently investigated."

    "text": "2 Materials and methods\nMultistage sampling technique was employed to select primary sampling units. The study was conducted in South West Garo Hills District of Meghalaya. Selsella Block was purposively chosen due to its high concentration of farmers practicing organic farming, agroforestry and other sustainable agriculture systems, based on the records with the Block Agriculture Office (BAO). Within this block, Harigaon and Sankarigre villages were selected as representative sites owing to their notable progress in integrated farming systems, organic farming practices and sustainable farming initiatives. A sampling frame was prepared for each village and 40 farmers (20 from Harigaon and 20 from Sankarigre) were selected through simple random sampling. The study area was purposively chosen to represent regions where traditional and sustainable farming systems coexist, enabling assessment of both the potential and the gaps in agroecological adoption.\nData were collected using the KoboToolbox platform through semi-structured, pre-tested interview schedule, field observations and participatory discussions with farmers. KoboToolbox facilitated efficient digital data capture on mobile devices, supporting offline data entry, conditional question logic and real-time synchronization, thereby ensuring accuracy and ease of data management for the study. The assessment of agroecological performance utilized the Food and Agriculture Organization’s (FAO) Tool for Agroecology Performance Evaluation “TAPE” (FAO [Food and Agriculture Organization] 2019). This comprehensive tool evaluates farm performance across ten key dimensions of agroecology: Diversity, Synergy, Efficiency, Recycling, Resilience, Co-creation and Sharing of Knowledge, Human and Social Values, Culture and Food Traditions, Responsible Governance and Circular and Solidarity Economy. ‘TAPE’ provides a holistic framework to measure and guide the transition toward sustainable agroecological systems by capturing environmental, social and economic aspects at the farm level (Mottet et al. 2020; Gharbi et al. 2025).\nAn (AAI) was developed to quantify the extent to which farmers practiced agroecological principles within their farming systems. The index was constructed using data obtained through content analysis of farmer interviews, field observations and participatory assessments. Each farmer’s practices were evaluated across the ten dimensions of agroecology defined by the ‘TAPE’.\nFor each dimension, a set of thematic indicators and sub-codes were identified to represent the corresponding agroecological attributes. The frequency and intensity of these codes across farms were used to indicate the relative level of adoption. The individual scores for all ten dimensions were aggregated for each respondent and standardized to obtain a composite index value. The formula used was: \\[\n\\text{Agroecology Adoption Index (AAI)} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_{i}}{n}\n\\tag{1}\\]\nwhere Xi represents the score (frequency of codes) obtained in each dimension and n is the total number of dimensions this study.\nThe resulting index values were classified into three categories i.e. Low, Medium and High based on the distribution of scores (mean ± standard deviation). This index provided a comprehensive measure of the level of agroecology adoption among farmers, integrating ecological, social and economic dimensions into a single analytical framework.\nDescriptive statistics such as mean, standard deviation, frequency and percentage were used to analyse the socio-economic characteristics of respondents and to provide a clear profile of the farming households. The relationship between socio-economic variables and the level of agroecology adoption was examined using correlation analysis to identify significant influencing factors.\nFor identifying and prioritising the constraints faced by farmers in adopting agroecological practices, Garrett Ranking Technique was employed. The major constraints identified during the preliminary survey were arranged in ascending order of importance by the farmers and converted into ranks using Garrett’s formula. These ranks were then transformed into scores with the help of Garrett’s table. The formula used for converting ranks into percentages is as follows: \\[\n\\text{Percent Position} = 100 \\left( \\frac{R_{ij} - 0.5}{N_{j}} \\right)\n\\tag{2}\\]\nwhere Rij = the rank assigned to the ith constraint experienced by the jth individual represents the position or order of importance given by each respondent to a specific constraint based on their perception and experience and Nj = the number of constraints ranked by the jth individual"

    "text": "3 Results\nThe socio-economic conditions and psychological factors of the farmers were examined by considering factors such as age, education, land holding, irrigation, annual income, family size, economic status, crop component, tree component, livestock component, renewable energy, risk-taking ability, attitude, innovativeness, market orientation and nutrition, culture and tradition.\n\n3.1 Socio- economic conditions and psychological factors of farmers\nA total of 40 farmers were selected for the study, and the results show that farmers in Meghalaya exhibited moderate levels of agroecological adoption influenced by socio-economic and psychological factors. About, 55.00 percent of middle-aged farmers demonstrate an optimal blend of experience and adaptability conducive to sustainable practices. Around 37.50 percent of small landholding farmers promote mixed farming and resource recycling, reflecting indigenous ecological knowledge. A significant 75.00 percent of farmers depend primarily on rainfed agriculture, with only 25.00 percent utilizing irrigation sources such as tube wells and ponds, highlighting the need for improved water management. Moderate income, evident in 85.00 percent of farmers and family labour availability support crop-livestock integration, enhancing resilience. However, renewable energy adoption remains low at 35.00 percent. Positive attitudes observed in 52.50 percent of farmers and moderate risk-taking, at 45.00 percent, contributing to gradual agroecology adoption, yet weak market orientation and limited institutional support continue to constrain broader uptake.\nGiven in Table 1, the correlation analysis shows that landholding size (\\(r = 0.482^{**}\\)), annual income (\\(r = 0.468^{**}\\)), crop component diversity (\\(r = 0.527^{**}\\)) and livestock component (\\(r = 0.498^{**}\\)) have strong, significant positive relationships with agroecological adoption. Irrigation access (\\(r = 0.356^{*}\\)) and renewable energy use (\\(r = 0.302^{*}\\)) are also significant, indicating the importance of infrastructure and resource availability. Among psychosocial factors, risk-taking ability (\\(r = 0.411^{**}\\)), attitude (\\(r = 0.563^{**}\\)) and innovativeness (\\(r = 0.474^{**}\\)) show significant positive correlations, highlighting their influence on adoption behaviour. However, age (\\(r = 0.214\\)), family size (\\(r = 0.188\\)) and market orientation (\\(r = 0.245\\)) show positive but non-significant correlations. Lastly, nutrition, culture and tradition (\\(r = 0.338^{*}\\)) show a significant correlation.

According to (FAO [Food and Agriculture Organization] 2019), farms scoring below 50.00 percent are considered non-agroecological systems, those scoring between 50.00 and 70.00 percent are classified as in transition to agroecological farms, while farms scoring above 70.00 percent are categorized as agroecological farms.\n“High” adoption was recorded in Diversity (72.10%), Synergies (70.50%) and Circular Economy (70.40%), reflecting diversified production and resource recycling rooted in traditional knowledge. “Medium” adoption was observed in Efficiency, Recycling, Resilience, Knowledge Sharing and Human & Social Values, showing partial institutionalization.” “Lower” adoption in Culture, Traditions (65.50%) and Governance (65.40%) indicates limited formal support and integration of indigenous cultural values. These results reveal progressive agroecological transition driven by diversification and synergy but constrained by governance and institutional gaps.\n\n\n\nTable 2: Agroecological performance of farms in Meghalaya based on FAO’s ten dimensions using AAI\n\n\n\n\n\nDimensions\nScore (%)\nCategory\n\n\n\n\nDiversity\n72.10\nHigh\n\n\nSynergies\n70.50\nHigh\n\n\nEfficiency\n69.50\nMedium\n\n\nRecycling\n67.50\nMedium\n\n\nResilience\n66.50\nMedium\n\n\nKnowledge Sharing\n66.30\nMedium\n\n\nHuman & Social Values\n67.30\nMedium\n\n\nCulture & Traditions\n65.50\nLow\n\n\nGovernance\n65.40\nLow\n\n\nCircular Economy\n70.40\nHigh\n\n\nAdoption level\n68.10\nTransition stage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Agroecological performance of farms in Meghalaya based on FAO’s ten dimensions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3 Constraints faced by farmer’s in in adopting Agroecological Practices in Meghalaya\nAs given in Figure 2 The study identified and ranked the major constraints hindering the adoption of agroecological practices. The study identifies limited market access (mean score 74.20) as the foremost constraint confronting farmers, significantly impeding their ability to connect agricultural produce with dependable buyers and efficient value chains. This challenge restricts market opportunities and adversely affects farm incomes. These findings corroborate earlier research by (Akoijam 2018), underscoring the persistent issue of inadequate market linkages as a critical barrier to agricultural advancement in Meghalaya.\nThe lack of training and education on agroecological practices ranked second (mean score 70.80), highlighting the need for systematic capacity-building initiatives to strengthen farmer’s understanding and adoption of agroecological principles. Limited knowledge on agroecology was the third major constraint (mean score 68.60), suggesting that while awareness of sustainable practices exists, deeper technical knowledge remains insufficient (Krishnan et al. 2024).\nThe lack of efficient value chains (66.30) and few policies based on agroecology (63.90) occupied the fourth and fifth ranks respectively, reflecting institutional and infrastructural gaps in promoting an enabling ecosystem for agroecological transition.\nLower-ranked constraints such as government subsidies favouring synthetic inputs (61.70), lack of assured market price (59.50) and climate variability (56.80) indicate systemic barriers that indirectly limit farmer’s motivation to adopt sustainable practices. The high initial investment for farm transition (54.20) and limited access to credit or finance (51.40) were ranked lowest, suggesting that although financial constraints exist, knowledge and market-related factors are perceived as more immediate challenges.\nOverall, these findings emphasize that market accessibility, farmer education and institutional support are key determinants influencing the adoption and sustainability of agroecological farming systems in Meghalaya. Strengthening local markets, developing value chains and implementing dedicated agroecology policies could substantially mitigate these constraints.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Major Constraints faced by farmers in adopting Agroecological practices in Meghalaya"

    "section": "4 Discussion",
    "text": "4 Discussion\nThe study shows that agroecology adoption in Meghalaya is influenced by farmers’ socio-economic and psychological characteristics. Middle-aged farmers adopt more, likely due to their practical experience and adaptability, aligning with (Singh 2024), who noted that experiential knowledge increases openness to sustainable innovations. Likewise, the tendency of small landholding farmers to practice mixed farming corresponds with (Tiwari and Pant 2018), who reported that indigenous farming systems in Meghalaya encourage integrated practices due to land constraints.\nFurthermore, the heavy reliance on rainfed agriculture underscores structural limitations in rural infrastructure, aligning with findings by (Tyngkan et al. 2022), who identified water insecurity as a key constraint to sustainable agricultural intensification in the region. Moderate income and family labour encourage crop–livestock integration, enhancing nutrient cycling and resilience. However, the low adoption of renewable energy reflects technological and financial barriers, a trend similarly reported by (Krishnan et al. 2024) in their analysis of sustainable technology uptake in hill farming systems. Psychological attributes, including positive attitudes and risk-taking ability, play a supportive role in gradual agroecological adoption. These findings are consistent with (Vikas and Ranjan 2024). Weak market orientation and limited institutional support hinder wider scaling, consistent with Akoijam (2018), who reported that inadequate market linkages and weak extension services remain major bottlenecks in Meghalaya’s agricultural sector.\nThe correlation analysis shows that socio-economic and psychological factors influence agroecological adoption. Larger landholdings, higher income and stronger market orientation support adoption, while limited resources restrict it. These results align with (T. K. Das, Borah, and Singh 2024; Nonglait, Khundrakpam, and Deka 2023), who found that weak market linkages, poor institutional support and resource constraints hinder agroecological progress in Meghalaya. Similarly, the significant correlations for crop components and livestock integration show that diversified farming strengthens ecological resilience, consistent with Tiwari and Pant (2018). Access to irrigation and renewable energy also showed positive associations, indicating that better water availability and sustainable energy use help facilitate the shift toward agroecological practice. This trend supports the argument by Krishnan et al. (2024) who reported that infrastructural support is essential for sustaining ecological transitions in rainfed and hill-based systems.\nIn addition to that, psychological factors such as attitude, risk-taking ability and innovativeness, were among the strongest predictors of adoption. These results align with, (Gokul et al. 2025), who emphasized that farmers’ mindset, openness to new ideas and willingness to take risks significantly enhance the likelihood of adopting agroecological practices. Lastly, the positive correlation of nutrition, culture and tradition indicates the continued influence of indigenous knowledge in promoting ecological farming. This is consistent with (Nicholls and Altieri 2018), who emphasized the role of cultural heritage in sustaining agroecological practices.\nThe results of the Agroecology adoption index reveal that farmers in Meghalaya are undergoing a gradual but uneven transition toward agroecology. The high scores in Diversity, Synergies and Circular Economy indicates strong indigenous practices in diversified cropping and resource recycling. This aligns with the findings of (Rai and Gurung 2022), who noted that traditional mixed farming systems in Northeast India form a strong foundation for agroecological intensification. Medium adoption levels in Efficiency, Recycling, Resilience, Knowledge Sharing and Human & Social Values suggest that while farmers are integrating ecological principles, these dimensions are not yet fully institutionalized. Similar patterns were reported by (Muthukumar and Joseph 2023), who observed that farmers adopt ecological practices informally but lack structured training, extension support and technical guidance. The low adoption in Culture, Traditions and Governance reflects gaps in the formal recognition of indigenous cultural systems within agricultural planning. This governance limitation observed in the present study aligns with the conclusion by (Chaudhury and Basumatary 2023), who reported that inadequate institutional backing slows the formal scaling of agroecology despite strong community-level ecological knowledge.\nThe results of the constraint analysis reveal that farmers in the Selsella block encounter multiple barriers that limit the adoption of agroecological practices. Limited market access was the most critical constraint, linked to poor infrastructure and low price realization. This aligns with (Marak and Choudhury 2022), who noted that weak market linkages restrict farmers’ access to profitable value chains. The lack of training and education, identified as the second major constraint. This observation aligns with (Ralte and Joseph 2023), who emphasized that limited skill development restricts farmers from adopting ecologically intensive farming systems.\nLimited knowledge about agroecology, despite general awareness, was ranked as the third major constraint. This aligns with (Goswami and Tiwari 2024), who found that hill-region farmers understand sustainability concepts but lack the technical skills to implement agroecological practices effectively. Institutional shortcomings such as inefficient value chains and limited policy support, also hinder farmers’ transition. These results align with (Sarmah and Debbarma 2023), who found that weak governance structures and inadequate policy frameworks slows agroecological scaling in Northeast India. Subsidies favouring synthetic inputs, unstable market prices, and climate variability, further challenge adoption. Similar issues were highlighted by (Kumar and Sen 2024), who reported that existing subsidy systems and price fluctuations discourage long-term ecological investment. Although financial barriers like high initial investment and limited credit access were ranked lower, they still remain relevant, similar patterns were observed by (R. Das and Nongrum 2022)."

    "text": "5 Conclusion\nThis study examined agroecological adoption in the Selsella block of Meghalaya and found a moderate transition level, influenced by farmers’ socio-economic characteristics, diversified farming practices and positive attitudes, but constrained by limited irrigation, weak market access and inadequate institutional support. The Agroecology adoption index score of 68.10% highlights strengths in Diversity, Synergy and Circular Economy, while revealing gaps in Governance and cultural integration. Major constraints include poor market connectivity, limited training and weak policy support. Strengthening market linkages, expanding farmer training and improving policy frameworks are essential to increase adoption and support sustainable rural development. By documenting the multidimensional status of agroecological adoption this study provides empirical evidence from a tribal rainfed region, where limited research exists. It offers policy-relevant insights into the socio-economic and institutional factors and contributes to policy development by identifying priority areas, such as market infrastructure, extension support, farmer training and governance mechanisms, that can guide future state-level strategies and frameworks aimed at scaling agroecology in Meghalaya."

    "section": "1 Introduction",
    "text": "1 Introduction\nCareer expectations play a critical role in shaping the professional pathways of agricultural graduates, yet these expectations differ substantially among key stakeholders, including students, educators, industry employers, and extension officers. Although the agricultural sector is widely perceived as offering strong career prospects-driven by global challenges such as food security, climate change, and the push for sustainable agricultural practices, there is often a measurable gap between these optimistic views and actual industry experiences. This misalignment can result in professional dissatisfaction, skills job mismatches, and reduced retention in the sector (Scasta 2018; Ganiev, Sanaev, and Pardaev 2018; Zinnah et al. 2001). Despite an increasing global demand for skilled agricultural professionals, many graduates continue to experience uncertainty in their career progression due to unclear advancement trajectories and limited visibility of growth opportunities within the sector and high competitions (Black et al. 2025; Hassen et al. 2025). These concerns are further amplified by work-life balance challenges, including extended working hours, seasonal workload peaks, and expectations of availability beyond regular schedules. Such conditions create a paradox wherein the sector presents significant opportunities but simultaneously imposes structural constraints that may undermine long-term career satisfaction and workforce stability (Mabaso and Monyane 2023; Adedapo et al. 2014). The importance of examining stakeholders’ career expectation variances lies in the discrete perspectives each group brings to the agricultural profession. While students focus on educational quality and employment prospects, educators emphasise curriculum relevance and skill development, employers prioritise practical competencies and productivity, and extension officers consider field realities and community engagement (Raju and Devarani 2023; Sadovska et al. 2025). Understanding this diversity of views helps identify key gaps and areas of convergence, offering a basis for targeted policy and institutional reforms.\nExploring stakeholders’ semantic perceptions is essential because students, educators, employers, and extension officers each frame agricultural careers through different experiential and institutional lenses. These perceptual differences influence how key dimensions such as job security, career advancement, competency relevance, and work-life balance are understood across the sector. Semantic differential analysis makes it possible to systematically capture these evaluative variations, revealing where expectations converge or diverge. Such evidence is critical for policy reform, as it identifies misalignments between graduate preparation and sectoral realities and highlights areas where curricula, skill development, and workforce strategies require adjustment. Based on this rationale, the study was conducted to examine the stakeholder perceptions to generate actionable insights for strengthening agri-graduates career readiness and aligning policy with contemporary agricultural workforce needs."

    "text": "2 Methodology\nThis study used a descriptive, quantitative research design to examine variations in career expectations among key stakeholder groups within the agricultural sector. The survey included 40 respondents selected through simple random sampling, such as Assistant Directors of Agriculture, Agricultural Officers, Bank Sector Employers, Private Sector Employers, and Faculty Members. The investigation was part of a larger research project on agricultural students’ career orientations, with stakeholder perceptions incorporated to provide a system-wide understanding of how career conditions are viewed across the agricultural hierarchy. Since stakeholders influence policy decisions, training programs, hiring practices, and workplace norms, assessing their perceptions is crucial for identifying gaps between educational preparation and workforce realities using semantic differentials.\nA structured questionnaire using a 7-point semantic differential scale was administered to capture nuanced stakeholder perceptions across four core career dimensions: job market accessibility, career advancement opportunities, job security, and work–life balance. Uniform bipolar adjective pairs (e.g., Secure-Insecure, Clear Path-Unclear Path, Balanced-Stressful) were applied across all stakeholder categories to ensure comparability. Content validity was established through expert review in agricultural extension, human resource development, and rural management. The resulting data were analysed using descriptive statistics, including means, standard deviations, and response ranges. Higher mean scores (above 5.5) were interpreted as indicating an optimistic perception, whereas lower scores (below 3.5) signalled apprehension or concern, enabling systematic identification of positive and negative evaluative trends. These statistical patterns revealed both convergence and divergence in stakeholder attitudes, providing an evidence base for policy adjustments and curriculum refinements aimed at strengthening agricultural career preparedness."

    "text": "3 Results\nThe analysis of career expectations among agricultural sector stakeholders reveals generally positive perceptions regarding several key aspects of the profession. The job market was viewed favourably (M = 6.01, 83.4%), with stakeholders indicating that they perceive the agricultural job market as highly accessible. Similarly, the demand for the profession (M = 5.82, 80.4%) and opportunities for skill enhancement (M = 5.82, 80.4%) were also seen in a positive light, reflecting confidence in the growing relevance of agricultural graduates and the abundant opportunities for professional growth.

Work schedule (M = 2.91, 31.8%) and personal time for family/leisure (M = 2.91, 31.8%) were rated lower, suggesting that agricultural professionals face challenges in balancing work and personal time. Issues with work-life balance (M = 3.35, 39.1%) and availability expectations (M = 2.42, 23.6%) further underscored the high demands placed on professionals in the field, with limited flexibility to manage personal and professional commitments."

    "section": "4 Discussion",
    "text": "4 Discussion\nThe findings of this study reveal a dual perspective among stakeholders in the agricultural sector. On the positive side, stakeholders’ express optimism about the job market, demand for the profession, and opportunities for skill enhancement, all of which indicate a favourable outlook on agricultural careers. These results align with existing research highlighting an increasing global demand for skilled professionals in agriculture, driven by critical issues such as food security, climate change, and the shift toward sustainable farming practices (Hassen et al. 2025; Santhanam-Martin et al. 2024). The agricultural sector is undergoing transformative changes that require a skilled and adaptive workforce capable of addressing these challenges (Dedieu et al. 2022). Moreover, the positive views on job security and career success found in this study echo broader findings suggesting that agriculture remains a stable career choice with promising long-term prospects, which enhances its appeal among younger professionals seeking secure and impactful career pathways (Scasta 2018; Bhurke and Patil 2018).\nOn the flip side, concerns regarding career progression and work-life balance present significant challenges. The career progression aspect was perceived as unpredictable (M = 3.53), mirroring earlier studies that have highlighted a lack of clear career paths and growth opportunities within the agricultural sector (Zulaikha, Martono, and Himam 2021). This uncertainty around career growth can hinder the professional development of agricultural graduates and may discourage them from pursuing long-term careers in the field (Manyasi et al. 2023; Wilkes and Burns 2019).\nMoreover, the concerns around work-life balance were particularly notable, with respondents expressing dissatisfaction with work schedules, personal time for family and leisure, and availability expectations (Suryaja and Thomas 2019; Guest 2002; Tijani and Omirin 2013). These low ratings suggest that agricultural professionals are often faced with demanding work conditions, which limit their ability to manage personal time and professional responsibilities effectively. These finding echoes research showing the growing significance of work-life balance in career satisfaction, especially in industries like agriculture, where irregular hours and seasonal pressures are common (Adisa et al. 2024; Kong, Wang, and Fu 2015).\nIn conclusion, the study underscores the need to address the concerns around work-life integration within the agricultural sector. While the sector is perceived positively in terms of career opportunities and job security, the lack of clear career progression and the strain on work-life balance may deter young professionals from committing to long-term careers in agriculture. As the sector continues to evolve, it is crucial for policymakers and institutions to focus on creating transparent career pathways, introducing work-life balance reforms, and fostering environments that support both professional development and personal well-being."

    "section": "5 Conclusion",
    "text": "5 Conclusion\nThe study demonstrates that stakeholders hold generally positive views regarding employment opportunities, job security, and skill development in the agricultural sector; however, concerns persist about unclear career advancement pathways and difficulties in maintaining work–life balance and even cases of job quitting and job hopping. These findings indicate perceptual gaps that, if unaddressed, may affect long-term satisfaction and retention. From a policy perspective, the results underscore the need for clearer, competency-linked career progression systems and measures that mitigate workload pressures, especially during seasonal peaks. Institutions can support this by aligning training with sectoral demands, strengthening career guidance, and improving transparency around growth opportunities. Ensuring structured advancement routes and reasonable work expectations can enhance both workforce stability and sectoral attractiveness."

Our approach complies with best practices recommended by DOAJ, OpenAIRE, and international scholarly communication standards.\n    \n\n    \n    1. Internet Archive\n    \n      The Internet Archive (Wayback Machine) serves as the primary preservation system for JOSTA. All full-text PDF files and their associated metadata are archived to ensure permanent availability, independent of website hosting or publisher infrastructure.\n    \n\n    \n      Access preserved JOSTA content:\n      \n      \n        Internet Archive – JOSTA Preservation\n      \n    \n\n    \n      Permanent archiving of article PDFs and metadata\n      Preservation of article landing pages and journal structure\n      Independent, third-party redundancy\n      Access ensured even if the journal website undergoes changes or becomes unavailable\n    \n\n    \n    2. Zenodo (CERN)\n    \n      JOSTA maintains an official community on Zenodo, managed by CERN and OpenAIRE. Zenodo preserves the article record, metadata, DOI information, and public documentation necessary for long-term scholarly stewardship.\n    \n\n    \n      JOSTA Zenodo Community:\n      \n      Zenodo – JOSTA Community\n    \n\n    \n      Preservation of article metadata and publication record\n      Stable DOI management independent of journal hosting\n      OpenAIRE-compliant metadata exposure\n      Long-term preservation provided by CERN infrastructure\n    \n\n    \n    3. GitHub repository\n    \n      The full journal website is maintained and version-controlled via GitHub. This provides a complete historical record of all article pages, metadata files, and website content, enabling restoration of any previous version if needed.\n    \n\n    \n      Permanent version history for all site files\n      Ability to roll back to earlier states of the journal\n      Independent redundancy outside hosting and archive networks\n    \n\n    \n    4. Publisher-maintained secure backups\n    \n      PAPAYA Academic Press (Statoberry LLP) maintains additional secure backup layers to provide long-term redundancy and continuity.\n    \n\n    \n      Regular cloud-based encrypted backups\n      Local mirrored storage\n      Offline archival copies (PDFs + metadata)\n      Secure storage of indexing, layout, and publication files\n    \n\n    \n    5. Preservation commitment\n    \n      By combining the Internet Archive (primary PDF and metadata preservation), Zenodo (metadata and DOI preservation), GitHub (versioned website backup), and internal archival layers, JOSTA ensures that all published content will remain permanently accessible regardless of organisational, technical, or infrastructural changes.",
