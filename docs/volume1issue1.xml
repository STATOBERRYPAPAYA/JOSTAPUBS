<h2 data-number="1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>In the post-globalization era, many countries witnessed high momentum in economic growth. However, this rapid growth failed to provide the much-needed ‘trickle-down’ effect at the expected rate. The unequal growth of different sectors exacerbated poverty and income inequality. Generally, poor people adopt various livelihood strategies such as smallholder entrepreneurship, participation in agricultural and non-farm labour markets, and migration to overcome poverty <span class="citation" data-cites="worldbank2007report">(World Bank 2007)</span>. The decision to adopt particular strategies is influenced by access to resources and gender power relations within the community and household.</p>
<p>In recent decades, the Indian agriculture sector has experienced a high level of feminization, accelerating rapidly. The poverty-induced shift of the male population from farm to non-farm activities for sustenance and better income is quite evident in the country’s economy <span class="citation" data-cites="itishree2018feminization">(Itishree et al. 2018)</span>. Therefore, providing credit and other input facilities to women is considered an important policy intervention for poverty alleviation and agricultural development in the country.</p>
<p>Financial inclusion—bringing all sections of society, regardless of socio-economic status, into the formal financial system—plays a pivotal role in any nation’s holistic development. The inclusion of marginalized sections of society in formal financial institutions is a critical prerequisite for eradicating poverty and fostering economic growth <span class="citation" data-cites="demirguckunt2008finance rangarajan2008report">(Demirguc-Kunt, Levine, and Detragiache 2008; Rangarajan 2008)</span>. Various studies have pointed out that countries with higher levels of financial inclusion exhibit better GDP growth rates <span class="citation" data-cites="demirguckunt2009finance">(Demirguc-Kunt and Levine 2009)</span>.</p>
<p>The microfinance movement has played a crucial role in addressing this national issue and has emerged as the single largest saviour of the rural poor from financial exclusion, especially for women. Among the different models, the Self-Help Group (SHG)-led microfinance model has evolved into the most prominent channel for financial inclusion and has become an integral and inevitable component of the rural economy in India <span class="citation" data-cites="dhar2016microfinance">(Dhar 2016)</span>. Ideally, poor people can invest small amounts in micro-enterprises to generate income for their livelihood. SHGs have been financing both income-generating and consumption-related needs of members. However, various studies have shown that earlier credit requirements were often used for consumption purposes <span class="citation" data-cites="sooryamoorthy2007microcredit vasantha2014challenges">(Sooryamoorthy 2007; Vasantha 2014)</span>.</p>
<p>Among income-generating activities, dairy enterprises are especially popular among farmers due to their familiarity with dairying and the opportunity for year-round cash flow, which facilitates easy loan repayment. The performance of SHGs in southern Indian states has been commendable in terms of loan repayment rates and the velocity of lending. In particular, the SHG movement in Kerala has gained significant attention due to its active role in the state’s poverty eradication programmes. A study on women’s participation in agriculture and allied activities found that over 95% of the work in the animal husbandry sector in rural Kerala was performed by women <span class="citation" data-cites="geethakutty2014impact">(Geethakutty et al. 2014)</span>. Furthermore, refinancing of dairy loans shows a positive trend and holds vast potential for enhancing the employment and income of poor households, especially women <span class="citation" data-cites="nabard2019status">(NABARD 2019)</span>.</p>
<p>The factors affecting the repayment performance of SHGs require thorough investigation, as they depend on multiple socioeconomic variables. Since only a limited number of empirical studies have examined the influence of such factors in India, this paper explores the group performance of SHGs and investigates the determinants of their repayment behaviour.</p>

<h2 data-number="2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="materials-and-methods"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Materials and methods</h2>
<p>The SHG movement in the study state, Kerala, began with the Kudumbashree Mission, which was implemented two decades ago with strong support from the state government. This study made use of both primary and secondary data. The secondary data regarding the dairy based SHG’s were collected from the State Poverty Eradication Mission of the Government of Kerala and also from its district offices. The primary data were collected from both SHG members and non-members during the period 2020–21.</p>
<p>In accordance with the objectives, a multistage random sampling technique was adopted. The high-altitude agro-economic zone was purposively selected due to the presence of a large number of dairy-financed SHGs in the area. From this zone, Idukki and Wayanad districts were selected purposively, as they are predominantly rural and host the highest number of dairy-financed SHGs.</p>
<p>Further, two blocks each were randomly selected from these districts: Nedumkandam and Adimaly from Idukki, and Mananthavady and Kalpetta from Wayanad. Only groups that had availed of dairy loans and had a minimum of three years of experience were included in the sample, based on the assumption that benefits of SHG participation would be meaningfully reflected over that time. From each selected block, 20 women SHGs were randomly chosen, resulting in a total sample of 80 groups.</p>
<p>Data on group performance—such as frequency of meetings, planned savings, transaction costs incurred, savings accumulated, interest rate charged, bank linkage loans availed, repayment schedule, income-generating activities financed, group size, financial inclusion status, and socio-economic profile of members—were collected through interviews with SHG leaders and inspection of register books.</p>
<p>Loan performance was assessed using both internal and external loan indicators, considering the average of the past two years. Intragroup lending performance was measured by the percentage of members who received internal loans annually. Repayment performance was assessed by the ratio of the amount repaid to the amount due (credit plus interest), separately for internal group loans (from group savings) and external bank linkage loans (from formal financial institutions).</p>
<p>The key performance indicators were calculated as follows:</p>
<p><span id="eq-eq1"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctext%7BSaving%20performance%7D%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Ctext%7BActual%20Savings%7D%7D%7B%5Ctext%7BPlanned%20Savings%7D%7D%20%5Ctag%7B1%7D"></span></p>

<p>The delinquency rate was used as a proxy for repayment performance and was computed using Equation&nbsp;3.</p>
<p><span id="eq-eq3"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctext%7BDelinquency%20rate%7D%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Ctext%7BVolume%20of%20Loans%20in%20Arrears%7D%7D%7B%5Ctext%7BTotal%20Loan%20Volume%20on%20Promised%20Date%7D%7D%20%5Ctag%7B3%7D"></span></p>
<p>A delinquency rate of 0 indicates complete repayment on schedule, while a value of 1 indicates complete delinquency. This measure follows the approach suggested by <span class="citation" data-cites="sharma1997repayment">(Sharma and Zeller 1997)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="feroze2011factors">(Feroze et al. 2011)</span>.</p>
<p>The factors affecting the delinquency rate were estimated using the Tobit maximum likelihood estimation technique, considering the censored nature of the dependent variable.</p>

<p>The saving performance of groups was evaluated by comparing the planned savings amount with the actual savings amount. The pre-decided/agreed amount of savings in respective groups was considered as planned savings amount. The details of category wise saving performance are elaborated in Table&nbsp;3. From Table&nbsp;3, it is well observable that average cumulative savings per member was Rs.19803 in the overall category and it varied from Rs.13161 of IMG category to Rs. 26040 of the LMG category. The average planned savings per group was worked out as Rs. 306812 over the years and the average achievement in the targeted amount was found to be Rs.295593. The savings performance ratio in the overall category was found to be 0.9665, which implies that 96.65 per cent achievement in the pre-planned amount. The high saving ratio of the selected SHGs showed a better level of financial decorum maintained by the groups in savings amount accumulation. The improved economic background of the state and livelihood options provided through microfinance activities could be the possible reason for the high saving performance in the study area. In contrast, the saving ratio reported by the other studies was quite low and it ranges from 71 per cent to 74 per cent only <span class="citation" data-cites="verhelle2003determinants feroze2010performance">(Verhelle and Berlage 2003; Feroze and Chauhan 2010)</span>. The detailed analysis across different age group categories showed that the saving performance of initial matured groups (98.11%) was relatively higher than the elder category groups. The divergence in the savings amount was observed in some groups mainly because of the adjustments of group savings to the outstanding loan arrears. The trend was observed more in elder category groups than younger ones. Such undesirable practices may affect the self-sustainability of groups in the long run.</p>

<p>The SHGs has been offering two types of loaning facility to its members, i.e., internal group loan and the external bank linkage loan. Even though the external bank linkage loan was taken in the name of generating productive purposes, its utilization was found to be diverted from the intended objectives. The utilization of external bank linkage loans across different portfolios is detailed in Table&nbsp;4. It could be seen from Table&nbsp;4 that 24.85 per cent of the availed loan was utilized for agricultural and allied activities and 10.58 per cent for the business purposes. The remaining 64.57 per cent of the loan availed was utilized for different consumption purposes. Among that loans, the maximum proportion of the loan was availed for meeting the requirements of children’s education (19.90%) followed by medical expenses (16.12%), household expenses (14.36%), and marriage and festival expenses (8.31%), respectively. The observations of the study found consistent with the findings of <span class="citation" data-cites="kumar2013access">(Kumar 2013)</span>, in which he reported that 70 per cent of the availed SHG loan was utilized for personal consumption purposes rather than financing income generation activities in Kerala.</p>

<p>The internal loaning performance of the group was captured through the percentage of members who received an internal loan per annum by considering the past two years’ loan distribution mechanism (Table&nbsp;5). On average, groups were capable of disbursing internal loans amounting to Rs. 370099 per annum in the study area. Among them, the long-matured groups’ loan magnitude was distinctly high, at Rs. 465506 per annum, due to the larger corpus fund availability. The tenure of establishment also influenced the magnitude of loan per member, which varied from Rs. 18100 to Rs. 31123 across different age group categories, with an overall average of Rs. 24844 per annum. The outreach of internal loans was found to be 95.24 per cent in the initially matured groups and increased to 99.32 per cent in elder (LMG) groups, with an overall average of 97.32 per cent. The analysis of internal loaning performance implies that the groups in the area were able to distribute their thrift money in a well-equitable manner.</p>
<p>The SHGs were availing loans from formal financial institutions to meet members’ extra financial requirements. The grading of groups was a mandatory criterion followed by the banks for the approval of bank linkage loans. The loan application from each group went through a three-level monitoring mechanism of the Kudumbashree Mission—namely, the Area Development Societies (ADS) committee at the panchayat ward level and the Community Development Society (CDS) committee at the panchayat level—for scrutiny. A recommendation letter from the CDS chairperson was a mandatory document for availing the bank linkage loan for SHGs. Such high-level scrutiny also helped banks assess the repayment capacity of each group.</p>
<p>The bank charged compound interest as per prevailing lending norms, which ranged from 11 to 13 per cent, based on the loan amount and the repayment duration chosen by the group. However, the groups were eligible for an interest subsidy of up to 7 per cent under the National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) interest subvention scheme. An additional 3 per cent interest subvention was provided by the state government to all Women SHGs (WSHGs) in the state.</p>
<p>The study observed that out of the total 80 groups, 4 groups (5%) had not availed any kind of bank credit in the past two years. The lack of consensus among members and risk-averse behaviour of these groups was reported as the reason, despite all groups having accessed at least one bank linkage since their inception. A maximum of eight linkages was observed among the selected SHGs. The processing time for loan applications was reported to be less than one month in the study area, and the repayment period of term loans varied from 3 to 5 years, depending on the loan amount.</p>

<p>The average bank linkage loan amount was found highest in long matured groups (Rs. 614545) followed by the MMG (Rs. 545536) and IMG (Rs. 417217) category, respectively. The credit-thrift ratio of the availed loans was computed to be 2.22:1, 1.75:1, and 1.57:1 in IMG, MMG, and LMG categories, respectively. The recently formed groups have a lesser amount of thrift and a huge demand for working capital, which could be the possible reason for the higher credit-thrift ratio in the IMG category. The credit–thrift ratio of SHG linkage loans reported by different studies varied from 1.4:1 to 6:1 <span class="citation" data-cites="satyasai2014whither verhelle2003determinants feroze2010performance">(Satyasai, Sahoo, and Smita 2014; Verhelle and Berlage 2003; Feroze and Chauhan 2010)</span>. The ratio in the elder groups was not found impressive; this was due to the ceiling on lending (Rs. 10 lakhs/group) fixed by the banks and also possibly due to the availability of high corpus funds with these groups.</p>
<p>The repayment period of internal loans varied from three months to two years in the selected SHGs. The interest rate of the internal loan has been decided as per the groups’ consensus and is being collected monthly. In the study area, the groups were charging 12 per cent simple interest for the internal group loan, i.e., 1 per cent per month. The demand for internal loans is high because of ease of availability, flexibility in the repayment schedule, and attractiveness in the interest rate. The maximum individual lending limit of the internal loan is updated based on the corpus fund availability and members’ demand. It was observed that the maximum lending limit of the internal loan amount ranged from Rs. 20000 to Rs. 75000 per member in the selected groups.</p>

<p>Furtherly, the repayment performance of the group was evaluated through the amount of loan repaid on the scheduled time. Although the SHGs nominally fixed the installment amount for monthly repayments, in practice, members repay their loans without any fixed installment schedule. The average repayment rate (Table&nbsp;6) of the internal loan was found to be 87.81 per cent, 87.16 per cent, and 84.62 per cent in initial, medium, and long matured category groups, respectively, with an overall average of 86.72 per cent. The category-wise analysis indicated that the delinquency rate was high in the case of the LMG category compared to the younger groups. These findings were in line with the observations of <span class="citation" data-cites="nedumaran2001impact feroze2011factors apmas2017impact">(Nedumaran, Palanisami, and Swaminathan 2001; Feroze et al. 2011; APMAS 2017)</span>, where they reported that repayment of internal group loans faces more challenges than repayment of external bank linkage loans. The utilization of loans for consumption purposes and flexibility in the loan repayment might be the plausible reason for the poor repayment rate of internal group loans in the study area. Besides that, the monitoring agencies of the SHGs were more concerned about the prompt repayment of the external loan amount and least bothered about the overall repayment scenario of the groups.</p>
<p>The SHGs have been keeping separate accounts for external bank linkage loans. It was observed that the groups in the study area were not charging any extra commission for the external bank linkage loan from its members. The availed bank loan amount has been distributed within the group as per the members’ requirement. The disbursed amount varied from Rs. 15000 to Rs. 100000 per member in the sampled SHGs as per the members’ requirements. The analysis of external loan repayment revealed that the repayment rate of the bank linkage loan was quite impressive in the sampled SHGs, with an overall average of 99.24 per cent. Out of the total 80 SHGs, only 7 SHGs were facing some level of challenges in the prompt loan repayment. The groups were eligible for the back-end subsidy for prompt loan repayment, which motivates the members for timely repayment. Moreover, the banks were more stringent in penalizing defaulters, which increases the burden on all the members and automatically creates peer pressure.</p>
<p>The opening of individual savings bank accounts has been considered a prerequisite for the economic empowerment of women <span class="citation" data-cites="satyasai2014whither">(Satyasai, Sahoo, and Smita 2014)</span>. The role of SHGs in the financial inclusion of members was also captured through the savings bank account penetration ratio (SBAP), i.e., the proportion of members having an individual savings bank account to the total. On average, more than 90 per cent of the group members had their own individual savings bank account in the selected SHGs. The highest SBAP ratio was observed in the LMG (96.04%) category, followed by MMG and IMG category groups. The financial literacy earned through SHG activities motivates the members to open individual bank accounts in large numbers.</p>

<p>Prompt loan repayment is an imperative factor that determines the financial sustainability of any microfinance initiatives. From the earlier economic performance analysis, it was observed that the repayment of the external bank linkage loans was quite impressive in the study area. However, the prompt repayment of internal loans lacking momentum. Thus, the factors affecting the repayment behaviour of internal group loans have captured through TOBIT censored regression model to identify the determinants of prompt loan repayment by taking the delinquency rate as a dependent variable. The sample mean of the different explanatory variables used in the model is detailed in Table&nbsp;7. The average delinquency rate was worked out to be 13.28 per cent and varied from zero (complete repayment) to 24.20 per cent in the selected SHGs.</p>

<p>The proper monitoring mechanism reduces the incidence of wilful default and enhances the group’s ability to collect debt in time. The number of group meetings held per annum was taken as a proxy for capturing the groups’ monitoring ability. Group meetings provide an opportunity to monitor the repayment performance of its members. In general, meetings were convened in members’ homes on a rotation basis. The average number of meetings conducted per annum was found to be 49.28 in the study area and ranged from 44 to 52 meetings per annum.</p>
<p>The variable peer pressure was captured through a dummy variable. It was observed that only 37 groups (46.25%) were exerting such kind of pressure on the group members for prompt loan repayment. Further, the self-selected groups have better understandings of their members, and the study assumed that it may lead to prompt loan repayment. The main screening of members occurred in the post group formation period. Therefore, both ex-ante and ex-post factors were considered for measuring the degree of self-selection <span class="citation" data-cites="wydick1999social">(Wydick 1999)</span>.</p>
<p>The intensity of self-selection was captured through the scale developing technique. It was set as a four-digit scale where each positive answer gets one point to assess the intensity of self-selection. The sum of four different indicators—whether groups were formed by voluntary consensus of all the members, whether members were dropped out on group law violations, whether groups explicitly decided to reject new applicants, and whether new members had joined in the post-inception period—were considered for scale development <span class="citation" data-cites="verhelle2003determinants feroze2011factors">(Verhelle and Berlage 2003; Feroze et al. 2011)</span>.</p>
<p>Out of the total 80 SHGs, 74 groups (92.50%) reported that they formed the group voluntarily without any external agency involvement. The number of groups that rejected the request of a new applicant was found to be 23 (28.75%), and 68 groups (85.00%) added new members even after the inception of the group. Only 9 groups (11.25%) reported member exclusion for violating the decorum of the group. The reasons for exclusion varied from poor attendance in group meetings to non-deposit of weekly savings contributions. The average self-selection score in the selected SHGs was found to be 2.18.</p>
<p>The homogeneity in the group was measured by considering different socio-economic characteristics of group members. The scale consists of six indicators: age, religion, education, occupation, landholding size, and marital status. One point was given for each of the following: whether the age range of members was less than 15 years, whether 80% of members belonged to the same religion, had the same marital status, same educational level, same income-earning activity, and similar landholding sizes <span class="citation" data-cites="verhelle2003determinants">(Verhelle and Berlage 2003)</span>.</p>
<p>The highest number of groups (71 SHGs) were homogeneous in marital status (87.5%). A total of 39 groups (48.75%) reported age difference among members within 15 years, and 42 groups (52.50%) reported homogeneity in educational status. About 50 groups (62.5%) reported homogeneity in occupational status, and 63 groups (78.75%) were homogeneous in landholding size. The lowest homogeneity was observed in religion, where only 15 groups (18.75%) were homogeneous. The homogeneity score in the selected groups varied from 2 to 5, with an average of 3.6.</p>
<p>Smaller groups tend to have better in-group coordination and control, reducing problems from asymmetric information <span class="citation" data-cites="ghatak1999economics">(Ghatak and Guinnane 1999)</span>. Thus, it was expected that smaller group size would lead to lower default. The number of members in the selected SHGs ranged from 11 to 20, with an average of 15.16 members.</p>
<p>The average number of children directly dependent on the group members was also considered to analyze its role in repayment. The mean dependency ratio was 1.84 and ranged from 1.16 to 2.35 children per member per group.</p>
<p>Groups fixed a maximum individual loan lending limit based on consensus. A higher loan limit may increase the likelihood of unwilling default. The individual loan limit was used as a proxy for this factor. It varied from Rs.20,000 to Rs.75,000 per member, with an overall average of Rs.43,360.</p>
<p>The tenure of group establishment was considered to analyze the role of experience in repayment. Older groups may better understand the repayment capacity of members based on past experience. The average group age was 127 months, ranging from 40 to 228 months in the selected SHGs.</p>

<p>Contrary to the earlier assumption, the coefficient of homogeneity was found to be positive and significant at the 1 per cent level. This implies that the homogeneity of the groups raises the chance for wilful default. In socially homogeneous groups, individuals strongly rely on the peer’s unconditional support and are thus more likely to ride free, which causes prolonged time for loan repayment.</p>
<p>As expected, peer pressure had a negative association with the delinquency rate. The groups that exerted pressure on their members by implementing strict rules and penalties for late repayment demonstrated better repayment performance.</p>
<p>The coefficient of the loan amount was found to be positive and significant at the 5 per cent level. The majority of members depended on agriculture and allied activities for their livelihood and followed a ‘balloon repayment schedule’ in the study area. The pronounced seasonality of farming income compelled members to delay timely repayment of internal loans, which were less penalized compared to external bank loans. Similar observations were made by <span class="citation" data-cites="khandker2017seasonality">(Khandker, Samad, and Badruddoza 2017)</span> from their Bangladesh-based study on microfinance institutions.</p>
<p>The coefficient of dependency ratio was found to be negative and significant in the estimated model. Groups with a higher dependency ratio showed better loan repayment performance, which contradicts earlier expectations.</p>
<p>Even though the other variables were not statistically significant, they exhibited interesting relationships with the delinquency rate. The coefficient of peer monitoring was negative, indicating that a higher number of meetings per year has a positive influence on prompt loan repayment.</p>
<p>Contrary to prior assumptions, the group size variable turned negative, indicating that larger groups had better repayment rates than smaller groups. The positive coefficient of the degree of self-selection suggests that groups with a high degree of self-selection were more prone to wilful default.</p>
<p>Lastly, the positive coefficient of group establishment tenure indicates that the tendency for delayed repayment was higher among elder groups compared to younger ones. Elder groups were more lenient with their repayment schedules, and many did not impose penalties for irregular payments, which eventually contributed to higher delinquency.</p>

<section id="discussion" class="level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>The study provides insights into the financial behaviour of dairy-based SHGs in Kerala, with specific focus on internal loan repayment performance and its determinants. The overall loaning performance showed encouraging trends, particularly with respect to the external bank linkage loans, which recorded a high repayment rate of 99.24 per cent. In contrast, internal loans exhibited relatively lower repayment rates, with an average of 86.72 per cent, highlighting a crucial area for improvement. The Tobit regression analysis identified peer pressure, group homogeneity, dependency ratio, and loan amount as significant predictors of delinquency. Peer pressure had a significant negative relationship with delinquency, reinforcing the notion that groups which enforce rules and repayment discipline are more successful in maintaining financial decorum. Interestingly, homogeneity showed a positive and significant effect on delinquency, which contradicts conventional expectations. This suggests that in highly homogeneous groups, social closeness may undermine financial accountability due to overreliance on peer leniency. A similar counterintuitive result was observed with the dependency ratio, where groups with more dependents showed better repayment rates—possibly due to heightened financial responsibility and urgency among members with larger families.</p>
<p>The positive association of loan amount with delinquency reflects the challenges of repayment under seasonal income patterns common in agriculture. Members following balloon repayment schedules were often unable to meet instalments on time, especially in the absence of strong penalties for internal loans. Although other factors like peer monitoring, group size, and selfselection were not statistically significant, their coefficients indicated meaningful directions: more frequent meetings and larger group size were associated with lower delinquency, while greater self-selection surprisingly hinted at more wilful default. Overall, the findings highlight that internal governance, socio-economic dynamics, and institutional design within SHGs substantially influence repayment behaviour. Strengthening peer accountability, revisiting group norms on loan penalties, and promoting financial literacy can enhance the sustainability of internal lending systems within SHGs.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The present study demonstrates that SHG-based microfinance has the potential to mobilize small savings from poor households while serving as an effective tool for the financial inclusion of women. The saving performance of the groups and the repayment of external bank linkage loans were found to be highly satisfactory in the study area. The integration of dairy activities—known for their ability to provide year-round income—has further supported the members in actively participating in microfinance initiatives. It was observed that a significant portion of group loans was utilized for consumption purposes, particularly for children’s education and medical expenses. Despite this, the repayment performance of external bank loans remained strong, indicating the effective functioning of dairy-based SHGs in rural areas. These groups have played a critical role in enhancing the economic resilience of poor households, especially women, by enabling them to manage their livelihoods more sustainably. Moreover, the experience gained through SHG participation has contributed to improved financial literacy among members. The findings of the study reaffirm the role of SHGs not only as credit providers but also as catalysts for promoting inclusive finance and empowering marginalized communities.</p>

<p>Sesame (<em>Sesamum indicum</em> L., 2n=2x=26) represents one of humanity’s most ancient cultivated oilseed crops, with archaeological evidence suggesting its cultivation dates back over 4,000 years <span class="citation" data-cites="bedigian2015systematics">(Bedigian 2015)</span>. Known by various vernacular names including Gingelly, Ellu in Malayalam, and Tila in Sanskrit, this crop holds profound cultural and religious significance, particularly in Indian traditions where sesame seeds feature prominently in Hindu religious ceremonies <span class="citation" data-cites="wei2015genetic">(Wei et al. 2015)</span>. The ancient Sanskrit etymology supports the hypothesis that sesame may have been the source of the first extracted vegetable oil, underlining its historical importance in human nutrition <span class="citation" data-cites="pathak2014value">(Pathak et al. 2014)</span>. Modern nutritional analysis reveals that sesame seeds contain 50–60% oil of exceptional quality, comparable to olive oil in its nutritional profile <span class="citation" data-cites="uzun2008variation anilakumar2010nutritional">(Uzun, Yol, and Furat 2008; Anilakumar et al. 2010)</span>.</p>
<p>Sesame oil demonstrates remarkable stability compared to other edible oils, primarily attributed to its rich content of natural antioxidants including sesamin, sesaminol, sesamol, sesamolinol, and squalene <span class="citation" data-cites="namiki2007nutraceutical kamaleldin2011sesame">(Namiki 2007; Kamal-Eldin, Moazzami, and Washi 2011)</span>. The oil’s high concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids, combined with its cholesterol-lowering and blood pressure-reducing properties, has renewed scientific and commercial interest in this ancient crop <span class="citation" data-cites="sankar2006pilot gouveia2014effects dalibalta2020health">(Sankar et al. 2006; Gouveia et al. 2014; Dalibalta, Majdalawieh, and Manjikian 2020)</span>.</p>
<p>Recent genomic studies have revealed the complex genetic architecture underlying sesame’s agronomic traits, with high-throughput sequencing technologies enabling the identification of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with yield components and stress tolerance <span class="citation" data-cites="zhang2013genetic wang2016genome yu2019pmdbase">(Zhang et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2016; Yu et al. 2019)</span>. These advances have opened new avenues for marker-assisted selection and genomic breeding approaches <span class="citation" data-cites="wei2016identification dossa2017transcriptomic">(Wei et al. 2016; Dossa et al. 2017)</span>.</p>
<p>Despite its nutritional superiority and agricultural advantages—including drought tolerance, low input requirements, and suitability for crop rotations due to its extensive taproot system <span class="citation" data-cites="ashri2007sesame">(Ashri 2007)</span>—sesame productivity remains disappointingly low. India, while leading globally in both cultivation area (1.8 million hectares) and production (0.87 million tonnes), achieves an average productivity of only 483 kg/ha, significantly below China (1,200 kg/ha) and Turkey (1,100 kg/ha) <span class="citation" data-cites="fao2020faostat yahaya2021genetic">(FAO 2020; Yahaya et al. 2021)</span>.</p>

<p>The experiment was conducted during October 2007 to February 2008 at the Department of Plant Breeding and Genetics, College of Horticulture, Vellanikkara. Seeds were sown in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Plot dimensions maintained a spacing of 45 cm between rows and 20 cm between plants, following standard agronomic practices for the region.Observations were recorded on ten randomly tagged plants per genotype for nine quantitative characters: days to flowering, plant height (cm), number of branches per plant, number of capsules per plant, capsule length (cm), number of locules per capsule, 1000-seed weight (g), seed yield per plant (g), and oil content (%).</p>

<p>Considerable variation was observed across all studied traits. Days to flowering ranged from 18.73 days (KYM-1) to 34.8 days (Tilarani) with a mean of 27.35 days. Plant height showed extensive variation from 31.40 cm (IVTS-06-12) to 107.97 cm (Soma), averaging 53.44 cm. Seed yield per plant, the most variable trait, ranged from 1.35g (IVTS-06-22) to 7.02g (SVPR-1) with a mean of 3.47g.<br>
The genetic parameters for the traits studied as a part of the experiment are presented in Table&nbsp;3.</p>
<p>Number of branches per plant (51.83%) and capsules per plant (43.56%) show the highest variability, indicating excellent prospects for selection and breeding. Low variability in 1000-seed weight (2.95%) suggests this trait is more genetically stable across genotypes.</p>
<p>All traits exhibited high broad-sense heritability exceeding 85%. The highest heritability was observed for locules per capsule (100%) followed by plant height (99.75%), seed yield per plant (98.69%), and number of capsules per plant (98.34%).</p>
<p>The significant genetic variation observed across all studied traits provides a robust foundation for sesame breeding programs. High heritability estimates (&gt;85%) for all traits indicate that observed phenotypic variation primarily reflects genetic differences rather than environmental effects, facilitating effective selection strategies <span class="citation" data-cites="allard1960principles kumar2016genetic">(Allard 1960; H. Kumar and Garg 2016)</span>. The combination of high heritability with high genetic advance for days to flowering, plant height, number of branches per plant, number of capsules per plant, and seed yield per plant suggests predominant additive gene action, making these traits responsive to simple selection methods <span class="citation" data-cites="burton1952quantitative singh2006biometrical">(Burton 1952; A.

<p>Path analysis as depicted in Table&nbsp;5 revealed that number of capsules per plant exerted the highest positive direct effect (1.106) on seed yield per plant, followed by capsule length (0.106), plant height (0.077), and 1000-seed weight (0.022). Conversely, number of branches per plant showed the highest negative direct effect (-0.231), followed by days to flowering (-0.108) and oil content (-0.020). The residual effect was 0.203, indicating that approximately 80% of variation in seed yield was explained by the studied traits. The negative direct effect of branches per plant (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?-0.231">) despite positive correlation suggests indirect benefits through increased capsule production. Plant height contributes mainly through indirect effects via capsule production. The analysis explains 79.66% of yield variation, indicating good model adequacy.</p>

<p>The clustering of genotypes from the same geographical origin into different groups confirms that genetic drift and selection pressure can create greater diversity than geographical separation (<span class="citation" data-cites="pandey2015morphological">Pandey et al. (2015)</span>; <span class="citation" data-cites="singh2020genetic">S. Singh et al. (2020)</span>). This finding has important implications for breeding programs, suggesting that local germplasm may harbor unexploited genetic diversity.</p>
<p>Cluster V (SVPR-1) shows highest yield potential, Cluster IV (Soma) exhibits superior plant architecture, and Cluster VI (KYM-1) offers early maturity with high oil content. Strategic crosses between distant clusters (III × IV) could maximize genetic variation in breeding populations.</p>
<p>Recent molecular diversity studies using SNP markers have corroborated these findings. <span class="citation" data-cites="wang2016genome">Wang et al. (2016)</span> analyzed 705 sesame accessions using genome-wide SNPs and found similar clustering patterns, with genetic diversity being more strongly associated with breeding history than geographical origin. The maximum divergence between Clusters III and IV (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D%5E2%20=%2075.04">) in our study corresponds to regions of low genetic similarity identified in genomic studies <span class="citation" data-cites="dossa2017transcriptomic">(Dossa et al. 2017)</span>.</p>
<p>Based on comprehensive evaluation, several genotypes emerged as superior performers across multiple traits as depicted Figure&nbsp;2. SVPR-1 demonstrated the highest seed yield (7.02 g/plant), while KYM-1 showed the earliest flowering and highest oil content. Soma exhibited exceptional plant architecture with maximum height and branching.</p>

<p>The combination of high heritability with high genetic advance for days to flowering, plant height, number of branches per plant, number of capsules per plant, and seed yield per plant suggests predominant additive gene action, making these traits responsive to simple selection methods <span class="citation" data-cites="burton1952quantitative singh2006biometrical">(Burton 1952; A. Singh and Chaudhary 2006)</span>. These findings align with recent reports by <span class="citation" data-cites="gangwar2021genetic">Gangwar et al. (2021)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="ahmad2020genetic">Ahmad et al. (2020)</span>, and <span class="citation" data-cites="yahaya2021genetic">Yahaya et al. (2021)</span>, who observed similar patterns in diverse sesame germplasm collections.</p>
<p>The strong positive correlation between number of capsules per plant and seed yield (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%20=%200.9558%5E%7B**%7D">) confirms this trait as the most reliable selection criterion for yield improvement. Path analysis further substantiated this relationship by revealing the highest direct effect (1.1063) of capsule number on seed yield. Similar findings have been reported in recent studies by <span class="citation" data-cites="kumar2019genetic">R. Kumar et al. (2019)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="gangwar2021genetic">Gangwar et al. (2021)</span>, and <span class="citation" data-cites="ahmad2020genetic">Ahmad et al. (2020)</span>. The characters plant height, branches per plant, capsules per plant, and oil content showed significant and positive association with seed yield per plant. Therefore, simultaneous improvement of seed yield may be possible through selection of these characters. These matched the reports and conclusions of <span class="citation" data-cites="kumar2022genetic">V. Kumar et al. (2022)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="patel2023genetic">Patel et al. (2023)</span>.</p>
<p>Modern breeding programs increasingly utilize these correlation patterns in genomic prediction models. <span class="citation" data-cites="zhang2013genetic">Zhang et al. (2013)</span> demonstrated that incorporating trait correlations into genomic selection algorithms improved prediction accuracy for seed yield by 25% compared to single-trait models. The strong genetic correlations observed in our study suggest that multi-trait selection indices could be particularly effective in sesame breeding <span class="citation" data-cites="yu2019pmdbase">(Yu et al. 2019)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="murthy1996">Murthy and Kulkarni (1996)</span> explained that wide adaptability of divergent types could be possible due to factors such as heterogeneity, genetic architecture of the populations, past history of selection, developmental factors, and degree of general combining ability. In the present study, varieties developed at the same location were found to be grouped in different clusters, indicating more divergence. For example, sesame varieties from Kerala Agricultural University were found to be grouped in Clusters II, IV, and VI. This confirms the earlier findings of <span class="citation" data-cites="raut1991">Raut et al. (1991)</span> that genetic drift and human selection could cause greater diversity than geographical spacing.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="angadi1976">Angadi (1976)</span> reported that varieties in a cluster with a high order of divergence among themselves would be the best breeding materials for achieving maximum genetic advance with regard to yield. Selection within a cluster might also be exercised based on the highest mean performance of the varieties for desirable traits such as seed yield.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This comprehensive genetic analysis of 40 sesame genotypes revealed substantial genetic variability suitable for breeding programs. High heritability estimates coupled with significant genetic advance indicate favorable prospects for genetic improvement through selection. Number of capsules per plant emerged as the most critical trait for yield improvement, while genetic divergence analysis identified optimal parent combinations for hybridization programs.</p>
<p>The identification of genetically divergent clusters provides a scientific basis for systematic breeding approaches. Integration of conventional breeding with molecular markers and genomic selection offers promising avenues for accelerating genetic gains. Future breeding efforts should prioritize crosses between genotypes from distant clusters while maintaining focus on high-performing individuals within clusters.</p>
<p>The superior genotypes identified in this study (SVPR-1, Soma, KYM-1, and Tilatara) represent valuable genetic resources for developing climate-resilient varieties with enhanced yield potential and oil quality. This research establishes a foundation for modern sesame breeding programs, contributing to the revival of this ancient yet underutilized crop in the context of sustainable agriculture and food security.</p>

<p>In India, the agricultural waste generated by crops is significantly higher than in many other countries. Due to the lack of suitable technologies for effective disposal, farmers often resort to burning the crop residues as a quick and convenient method to clear fields. According to <span class="citation" data-cites="singh2014">Singh and Kaskaoutis (2014)</span>, about 43% of the total crop stubbles produced in India is burnt in-situ, contributing substantially to air pollution. One promising solution to mitigate the environmental impact of crop residue burning is the conversion of crop residues into biochar, a carbon rich material produced through pyrolysis. <span class="citation" data-cites="punnoose2015article">Punnoose and Anitha (2015)</span> has reported that biomass possesses several beneficial physical properties including low bulk density, high porosity, and higher water holding capacity. When applied to soil, these properties make biochar, an effective soil conditioner, enhancing both water and nutrient retention in soil and improves the crop yield. In Kerala, tender coconut husk is a prominent form of agricultural waste which requires efficient and ecofriendly disposal methods. Although, a portion of this agricultural waste is currently utilized through composting or as mulch in coconut gardens, these practices are insufficient relative to the large volume of waste produced. The dried tender coconut husk holds significant potential for conversion into biochar, which can then be recycled back into agricultural use to boost soil productivity. The Onattukara tract spread over three districts of Kerala (Alappuzha, Kollam and Pathanamthitta) presents a unique challenge due to its coarse textured, sandy loam soils with inherently low nutrient status. This type of soil is prone to nutrient leaching, especially during rainfall, rendering the applied fertilizers as less effective. Given biochar’s ability to improve soil moisture retention and reduce nutrient leaching, it represents a promising amendment for such type of soils. Therefore, a study was conducted to evaluate the potential of tender coconut husk biochar as a soil conditioner for okra cultivation in the sandy loam soils of Onattukara region.</p>

<p>A field experiment was conducted during the summer of 2023 in the wetlands of the Instructional Farm attached to Onattukara Regional Agricultural Research Station, Kayamkulam, Kerala. The research station is situated at 9.177° North latitude and 76.517° East longitude and at an altitude of 3.05 m above mean sea level. The treatments were laid out in randomized block design comprising of eight treatment combinations of biochar along with two levels of recommended dose of nutrients for okra along with a control and were replicated thrice.

<p>Prior to sowing, the experimental area was cleared of stubbles and clods were broken thoroughly. Dolomite was applied uniformly at the rate of 1 t ha<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5E%7B-1%7D"> and was incorporated in soil during primary tillage. The field was laid out as per the treatment design. After the layout, biochar and farmyard manure, along with half N, full P and full K of chemical fertilizers were applied in soil as per the treatments just before sowing. The remaining N was given in soil at one month after sowing along with intercultural operations and earthing up. The seeds of okra var. Arka Anamika were sown in lines in the main field at a spacing of 60 cm × 30 cm. The crop was sown during the last week of January 2023. After sowing, uniform population was maintained by thinning and gap filling. Five random plants from each net plot were selected and tagged as observational plants for recording observations.</p>
<p>The number of days taken for the first flower to open was noted and the mean was worked out. To find the number of fruits per plant, the fruits obtained from different harvests from each of the five observational plants were recorded separately and the average was worked out. The length of the fruits, from the tip of the fruit to the stalk end, was measured from the observational plants and the average was calculated and expressed in cm. The weight of the fruits harvested from each of the observational plants was recorded after each harvest. After the final harvest, the total weight of fruits obtained from the observational plants at different harvests were worked out, averaged and expressed in kilograms for fruit yield per plant. The weight of fruits from each plot excluding the border plants was recorded after each harvest and summed at the end of the cropping season to compute the yield in terms of kg per plot and was converted into t ha<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5E%7B-1%7D">.</p>
<p>The harvest index was calculated using the following formula suggested by Donald and Hamblin (1976). It was calculated by dividing the economic yield with biological yield of the plant. Sample plants collected from each plot were chopped into small pieces and were sun dried. After the initial drying, the samples were dried in oven to attain constant weight. The samples were then ground to pass through a 0.5 mm mesh and the required quantity of samples were digested and used for nutrient analysis following standard procedures. The nutrient uptake was calculated and expressed in kg ha<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5E%7B-1%7D"> according to Equation&nbsp;1.</p>
<p><span id="eq-eq1"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctext%7BNutrient%20uptake%20(kg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D%5Ctext%7B)%7D%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Ctext%7BNutrient%20content%20(%5C%25)%7D%20%5Ctimes%20%5Ctext%7BDry%20matter%20production%20(kg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D%5Ctext%7B)%7D%7D%7B100%7D%20%5Ctag%7B1%7D"></span></p>
<p>The composite soil samples from the field before the experiment and from each plot after the experiment were collected, air dried, powdered and passed through a 2 mm sieve and analysed for physico-chemical properties of the soil (Table&nbsp;1). The soil samples passed through 0.2 mm sieve were used for organic carbon estimation. Values represented in Table&nbsp;1 are initial soil values.</p>

<p>The application of biochar significantly influenced certain yield traits of okra. Days to flowering ranged between 35 and 37 days after sowing (DAS) across all treatments, but the differences were not statistically significant. Similarly, the number of fruits per plant and fruit length did not differ significantly among treatments. However, fruit yield per plant was significantly affected by biochar application (Table&nbsp;2). Treatment t4 resulted in the highest fruit yield per plant (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?544.93%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bg%7D">) and was statistically at par with t3 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?537.74%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bg%7D">), while the lowest was recorded in t9 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?380.24%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bg%7D">).

<p>The treatments did not influence the days taken to flower in okra. In general, regardless of the treatments, the okra plants started to flower between 35 DAS and 37 DAS. The number of fruits per plant and length of fruits were not influenced by biochar. However, the fruit yield per plant was significantly improved by the incorporation of biochar. The highest yield per plant was obtained from t4 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?544.93%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bg%7D">) and was found to be on a par with the treatment t3 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?537.74%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bg%7D"> per plant). There was 35.60 per cent increase over t9. Higher fruit yield per plant was observed for the plants that received biochar and FYM along with 100 per cent recommended dose of fertilizers (RDF). The adsorbing property of biochar in sandy loam soil might have slowed down the release of nutrients from FYM and chemical fertilizers. As the amount of biochar was doubled, there was an increase in fresh weight of fruits. This is in accordance with the findings of <span class="citation" data-cites="dainy2015">Dainy (2015)</span> who also reported a progressive increment in the yield characters in yard long bean as the levels of biochar was enhanced from 10 to 30 t ha<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5E%7B-1%7D"> when applied along with the recommended dose of fertilizers. Similar reports of increased yield with the incorporation of biochar and RDF were also reported by <span class="citation" data-cites="punnoose2015thesis">Punnoose (2015)</span> in amaranthus and <span class="citation" data-cites="hashmi2019">Hashmi et al. (2019)</span> in <em>Pisum sativum</em> L. In the case of fruit yield ha<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5E%7B-1%7D">, the application of tender coconut husk biochar had significantly improved the yield per hectare in okra. Higher fruit yield per hectare was observed for the treatment t4 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?15.71%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bt%7D">) and was on par with t3 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?14.07%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bt%7D">). The control plants (t9) could only produce <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?7.65%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bt%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">. Overall, there was a yield increase of 69 per cent in t4 compared to t9. The lower yield in t9 might be due to the leaching loss of nutrients. There was 44 mm rainfall during the growth period of okra at Onattukara which might have aggravated the leaching loss in the sandy loam soils of Onattukara. <span class="citation" data-cites="nagula2017">Nagula (2017)</span> had also recommended the application of biochar (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?@"> 10 kg ha<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5E%7B-1%7D">) along with RDN for higher yield in banana. The harvest index was also significantly influenced by the treatments. The treatment t3 recorded a higher harvest index of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0.81"> and was found to be on a par with the treatments t4 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0.81">), t2 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0.79">), t1 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0.79">) and t8 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0.77">). Thus, biochar as a soil conditioner along with FYM and full recommended dose of fertilizers was effective for okra in the sandy loam soils of Onattukara.</p>

<h3 data-number="4.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="nutrient-uptake-1"><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Nutrient uptake</h3>
<p>The N uptake in okra was significantly improved due to the treatments. Among the treatments, the highest N uptake was recorded by the treatment t4 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?101.35%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">) and was found to be on a par with t3 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?95.93%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">), t2 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?92.90%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">), t6 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?92.70%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">) and t5 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?91.93%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">). Lower N uptake was recorded in t9. There was an increase of 30.14 percent in the N uptake (t4) compared to control (t9). This might be due to the adsorbing capacity of biochar applied as soil conditioner. The higher CEC for biochar might have helped in retaining N in the sandy loam soils of Onattukara. The full RDN along with FYM (5 t ha<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5E%7B-1%7D">), combined with the adsorbing property of biochar might have contributed to a higher status of available N in soil and led to an increased uptake of N by okra. <span class="citation" data-cites="dainy2015">Dainy (2015)</span> had earlier reported that the total N uptake in yard long bean was found to increase from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?51.19%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D"> to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?105.50%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D"> due to the application of biochar, PGPR and full recommended dose of nutrients. <span class="citation" data-cites="jabin2022">Jabin (2022)</span> had also reported that total N uptake was higher in ginger when treated with paddy husk biochar (30 t ha<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5E%7B-1%7D">) along with full dose of fertilizers in sandy soils. Similarly, <span class="citation" data-cites="nigussie2012">Nigussie et al. (2012)</span> had also reported a higher N uptake in lettuces grown in soils conditioned with 10 t ha<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5E%7B-1%7D"> biochar suggesting the prospects of biochar to raise fertilizer use efficiency in soils where N loss is high.</p>
<p>A significant difference was observed in P uptake among the treatments. Higher P uptake was observed for t7 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?24.76%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">) and was on a par with t8 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?23.73%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">), t6 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?22.57%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">), t5 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?19.98%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">) and t3 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?19.60%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">). This increase in P uptake might be due to the higher quantity of available P in soil which is evident from the soil samples collected after the harvest of okra (Table&nbsp;6). In acidic soils, the solubility of P and its uptake by plants depends mainly on the formation of Al and Fe-phosphates in soil. When biochar is applied to acidic soil condition, it raises the soil pH. There is a reduction in the P binding to Fe and Al oxides, thus making P available in soil. Similar reports of improved P availability in acid soils due to supplementation of biochar was observed by <span class="citation" data-cites="chintala2014">Chintala et al. (2014)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="zhang2016">H. Zhang et al. (2016)</span>. On the contrary, <span class="citation" data-cites="dainy2015">Dainy (2015)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="jabin2022">Jabin (2022)</span> had reported a higher P uptake in yard long bean and ginger, treated with biochar along with NPK as per <span class="citation" data-cites="kau2016">KAU POP (2016)</span>. The uptake of K was not significantly influenced by the treatments.</p>
<p>Significant effect for Ca uptake was observed in okra (Table&nbsp;4). The highest Ca uptake was recorded by the treatment t6 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?64.94%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">) and was noticed to be on a par with treatment t3 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?59.72%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">), t7 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?59.38%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">) and t4 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?58.61%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">). Lower Ca uptake was recorded by the treatment t9 (KAU POP). There was an overall increase of calcium uptake by 44.96% in t6 compared to the control t9. The application of biochar along with liming prior to planting okra was found to improve the availability of calcium in soil which might have led to an increased plant uptake. Earlier, <span class="citation" data-cites="sombroek1993">Sombroek, Nachtergaele, and Hebel (1993)</span> had also reported increased calcium availability for plant growth after the application of biochar due to the higher surface area, negative surface charge and charge density. Moreover, calcium in biochar may exchange Al ions present on the soil organic matter and enhance the availability of calcium for plants thus, guiding it to an increased calcium uptake by the plants <span class="citation" data-cites="novak2009">(Novak et al. 2009)</span>. <span class="citation" data-cites="dainy2015">Dainy (2015)</span> had also reported higher Ca uptake in yard long bean due to the application of biochar. In sandy soils, <span class="citation" data-cites="jabin2022">Jabin (2022)</span> also observed a higher calcium uptake in ginger.</p>
<p>The uptake of Mg was observed to be significant (Table&nbsp;4). The treatment t4 resulted in higher Mg uptake (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?20.47%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">) by okra and was noticed to be on a par with the treatment t3 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?19.84%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">), t6 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?19.61%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">) and t8 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?19.60%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">). The Mg in soil increases with increase in soil pH. There was an increment in soil pH from the initial value of 5.38 (Table&nbsp;1) to 5.87 (Table&nbsp;5) due to application of biochar in combination with the effect of liming. This might have improved the exchangeable magnesium in soil which has resulted in an increased magnesium uptake in okra. <span class="citation" data-cites="jabin2022">Jabin (2022)</span> has also reported an increased magnesium uptake in ginger due to application of biochar. Tender coconut husk biochar had 0.13 percent magnesium <span class="citation" data-cites="vikram2024">(Vikram et al. 2024)</span>. This might have contributed to the higher magnesium content in t4. <span class="citation" data-cites="dainy2015">Dainy (2015)</span> had also reported an increase in total Mg uptake in yard long bean when biochar (@ 20 t ha<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5E%7B-1%7D">) was applied with RDN. The uptake of sulphur was not significantly influenced by the treatments.</p>
<p>Copper uptake was found to be significant (Table&nbsp;4) for the treatments. Higher copper uptake in okra was observed for the treatment t1 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1.82%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">) and was found to be on a par with the treatment t3 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1.73%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">). There was an increase in copper content in soil from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1.31%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bmg%20kg%7D%5E%7B-1%7D"> (Table&nbsp;1) to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1.45%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bmg%20kg%7D%5E%7B-1%7D"> (Table&nbsp;7) due to the application of biochar. This might have contributed to the increased uptake of copper in okra. Similar reports of increased copper uptake were noticed in yard long beans by <span class="citation" data-cites="dainy2015">Dainy (2015)</span> and in rice by <span class="citation" data-cites="salvacion2020">Salvacion and Pangga (2020)</span> due to the application of biochar.</p>
<p>The uptake of zinc was not significantly influenced by the treatments. The uptake of iron in okra was found to be significant (Table&nbsp;4). Higher iron uptake was observed for t6 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0.96%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">) and was perceived to be on a par with treatment t1 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0.88%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">) and t3 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0.82%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">). The biochar produced from tender coconut husk contains <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?107.58%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bmg%20kg%7D%5E%7B-1%7D"> of iron <span class="citation" data-cites="vikram2024">(Vikram et al. 2024)</span>, and hence its application as a soil conditioner had increased the soil iron content. The initial soil available iron was <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?14.74%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bmg%20kg%7D%5E%7B-1%7D"> (Table&nbsp;1) and was increased to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?15.53%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bmg%20kg%7D%5E%7B-1%7D"> (t6 – Table&nbsp;7) due to the application of biochar. This might be the reason for the increased availability of iron in soil which might have contributed to the increased iron uptake in t6 treatment. Similar report of increased iron uptake in yard long bean was observed by <span class="citation" data-cites="dainy2015">Dainy (2015)</span>.</p>
<p>The uptake of boron was not significantly influenced by the treatments. The uptake of manganese was found to be significantly influenced by the treatments (Table&nbsp;4). Among the treatments, the highest uptake of manganese was recorded by the treatment t8 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1.69%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">) and was observed to be on a par with treatment t7 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1.68%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">), t4 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1.67%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">), t6 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1.61%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">) and t2 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1.46%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">). The application of biochar had slightly improved the soil available manganese. This might have improved the plant uptake of manganese in okra. Earlier, <span class="citation" data-cites="dainy2015">Dainy (2015)</span> had also reported the increase in total uptake of manganese from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?559.93"> to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1140.50%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D"> due to application of biochar in yard long bean.</p>

<p>The soil water holding capacity after cultivation of okra was significantly modified due to the treatments. The initial water holding capacity of the soil from the experimental area (Table&nbsp;1) was <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?10.47%5C%25">. The treatment t4 recorded a significantly higher WHC (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?33.87%5C%25">) and was found on a par with t8 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?33.02%5C%25">), t3 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?32.73%5C%25">), t2 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?32.65%5C%25">) and t7 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?32.61%5C%25">). An increase of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?20.68%5C%25"> in water holding capacity was observed in t4 (compared to control). An overall increase of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?105.55%5C%25"> of WHC could be obtained due to application of biochar in the sandy loam soils of Onattukara. The initial analysis of tender coconut husk biochar had revealed that it had a water holding capacity of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?232.34%5C%25">. This biochar when applied to soil reduces the bulk density of soil and is the reason for the higher water holding capacity of the soil. There was <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?57.92%5C%25"> increase in WHC with the application of biochar along with NPK as per POP recommendation <span class="citation" data-cites="dainy2015">(Dainy 2015)</span>. <span class="citation" data-cites="wang2019">Wang et al. (2019)</span> has also reported that biochar can temporarily increase the field capacity due to their higher pore volume in a coarse textured soil.</p>
<p>The bulk density of soil was found to be significantly reduced by the treatments. The initial bulk density of the soil from the experimental area was <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1.61%5C%20%5Ctext%7BMg%20m%7D%5E%7B-3%7D">. In general, biochar had significantly reduced the soil’s bulk density. KAU 2016 (t9) recorded the highest bulk density (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1.30%5C%20%5Ctext%7BMg%20m%7D%5E%7B-3%7D">) in soil and the lowest was recorded for the treatment t8 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1.21%5C%20%5Ctext%7BMg%20m%7D%5E%7B-3%7D">). Overall, there was a reduction in bulk density by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?28.37%5C%25"> compared to the initial value indicating the potential for increased water holding capacity. There are several reports of decreased bulk density with application of biochar <span class="citation" data-cites="laird2010 jones2010 chen2011 mankasingh2011 zhang2012">(Laird et al. 2010; Jones, Haynes, and Phillips 2010; Chen et al. 2011; Mankasingh, Choi, and Ragnarsdottir 2011; A. Zhang et al. 2012)</span>. <span class="citation" data-cites="dainy2015">Dainy (2015)</span> had also reported in yard long bean that the application of biochar had lowered the bulk density of soil. The pH, electrical conductivity and CEC in soil after the experiment was not significantly influenced by the treatments.</p>
<p>The organic carbon content of the soil after the experiment was significantly governed by the treatments. Higher organic carbon was noticed for t4 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1.29%5C%25">) and was on par with t8 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1.26%5C%25">), t3 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1.25%5C%25">), t2 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1.23%5C%25">), t7 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1.23%5C%25">), t1 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1.19%5C%25">) and t6 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1.17%5C%25">). The control treatment (t9) recorded the lowest organic carbon content (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0.96%5C%25">). There was an overall increase of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?29.33%5C%25"> in t4 compared to KAU (2016) due to the application of biochar. The initial organic carbon content in soil before the experiment was <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0.53%5C%25"> (Table&nbsp;1). Biochar produced from tender coconut husk had a total organic carbon content of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?48.14%5C%25"> <span class="citation" data-cites="vikram2024">(Vikram et al. 2024)</span>, and application of this might have helped in the increased carbon content in biochar applied plants. In amaranthus, <span class="citation" data-cites="punnoose2015article">Punnoose and Anitha (2015)</span> had also reported higher organic carbon content in biochar applied plants.</p>
<p>There were significant effects on available N in soil. Higher available N was observed for t4 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?209.07%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">) and was on a par with the treatments t3, t7 and t8 with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?196.52%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">. This might be due to the increased retention of nitrogen in soil due to the application of biochar. <span class="citation" data-cites="punnoose2015thesis">Punnoose (2015)</span> had also reported an increased nutrient content in biochar applied soils. The control (t9) recorded an available N content of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?183.98%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">. There was <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?44%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bmm%7D"> of rain during the crop period which might have leached out the available N in soil leading to a comparatively lesser available N in soil. The lowest available N was recorded for t5 and t6 with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?163.07%5C%20%5Ctext%7Bkg%20ha%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">. The lower dose of fertilizer without the application of FYM might have led to the lowest available N in soil.</p>

<p>Price volatility is one of the significant sources of risk in agriculture especially in fruits and vegetable production. It is defined as the directionless fluctuations in prices that cannot be predicted with market fundamentals <span class="citation" data-cites="prakash2011">(Prakash 2011)</span>. Reasons for price volatility include supply-side shocks due to severe weather events or diseases, variations in demand, distortions in trade policies and supply chain disruptions <span class="citation" data-cites="gilbert2010 ait_sidhoum2016">(Gilbert and Morgan 2010; Ait Sidhoum and Serra 2016)</span>. The increasing unpredictability of changing economic and natural environment <span class="citation" data-cites="tothova2011">(Tothova 2011)</span> and seasonal nature of the fruits and vegetables also amplifies price volatility. Moreover, poor shelf life of horticulture crops increases risk and leads to unstable markets <span class="citation" data-cites="cook2011">(Cook 2011)</span>.</p>
<p>Vazhakulam in Ernakulam district has become the major hub for pineapple cultivation in Kerala <span class="citation" data-cites="joy2013">(Joy 2013)</span>. Owing to its unique feature Vazhakulam pineapple has got Geographical indication tag also. Pineapple produced from the region has a long value chain and is marketed to various states like Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Delhi mainly through road ways. Limited quantity of fresh pineapple is being exported to Gulf countries in special packings <span class="citation" data-cites="pga2018">(Pineapple Growers Association 2018)</span>.</p>
<p>Pineapple is a globally traded fruit crop from Kerala that had always been subject to price volatility. It is mainly because of the seasonal variations in demand for pineapple in markets. Climate change induced low production, seasonal disruptions in demand and supply are the main factors that affect price volatility. It was noted that the COVID induced lock down had severely affected the pineapple prices and farmer suicides were reported during the period. This pandemic had a significant negative impact on all sectors of human life, including the economy, food security and health <span class="citation" data-cites="saadat2020">(Saadat, Rawtani, and Hussain 2020)</span>. According to <span class="citation" data-cites="jribi2020">(Jribi et al. 2020)</span>, the pandemic had the potential to hinder the progress towards meeting several Sustainable Development Goals (United Nations SDG 2015-2030), in particular, SDG 2 (End Hunger) and SDG 12 (Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns). There were widespread disruptions in agriculture supply chain at the beginning of the lockdown <span class="citation" data-cites="fao2021">(FAO 2021)</span>. It further lead to the scarcity of labour, disrupted supply chains and lack of demand and logistics restrictions in the agricultural sector <span class="citation" data-cites="cariappa2021">(Cariappa et al. 2021)</span>.</p>
<p>Although the price volatility of different agricultural commodities has been researched extensively in recent periods <span class="citation" data-cites="gilbert2010 sabu2019 yu2020">(Gilbert and Morgan 2010; Sabu, Kuruvila, and Manojkumar 2019; Yu et al. 2020)</span>, a lack of knowledge exists in the pineapple sector of Kerala. The knowledge about the price risk and volatility associated with the pineapple sector is important for pineapple farmers during the pandemic. This information is critical for developing suitable price risk management strategies, for coping up with similar situations. Hence the present study aims to analyse the price behaviour of Pineapple in Kerala.</p>

<p>The study was conducted in Ernakulam district of Kerala. The study area was selected purposively as it has the largest area under pineapple cultivation in Kerala. Out of the total area under pineapple in Kerala, 58.73 per cent lies in Ernakulam district which produces about 63 per cent of the production of the state in the year <span class="citation" data-cites="gok2020a">(Government of Kerala 2020a)</span>. From the district, Muvattupuzha Block Panchayath was purposively selected based on the maximum area under pineapple cultivation. Three pineapple-growing grama panchayats viz., Avoly, Manjalloor, and Kalloorkkad were selected from the block panchayat randomly. Forty farmers each were randomly selected from these grama panchayaths making a total sample size of 120 farmers.</p>

<h3 data-number="2.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sampling-and-data-collection"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Sampling and data collection</h3>
<p>The study used time series data of daily prices of pineapple from January 2017 to September 2022 collected from Vazhakulam Pineapple Growers Association(PGA). Price collected can be aptly considered as representative price as most of the pineapple farmers are organized under PGA and trade pineapple through them. The prices represent the farm gate price received by the farmers and it is easily available in the website of Pineapple Growers Association<span class="citation" data-cites="pga2018">(Pineapple Growers Association 2018)</span>. Data on daily prices of pineapple from January 2017 to March 2020 was taken as pre-COVID period and from April 2020 to September 2022 is taken as COVID-post-COVID period. January 2017 to September 2022 was taken as the overall period.</p>

<h3 data-number="2.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="garch-models"><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> GARCH models</h3>
<p>The uncertainty surrounding prospective price fluctuation is referred to as volatility. There are different methods to estimate volatility such as historical moving average, Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA), Auto Regressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (ARCH) introduced by <span class="citation" data-cites="engle1982">Engle (1982)</span> and Generalized Auto-Regressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) introduced by <span class="citation" data-cites="bollerslev1986">Bollerslev (1986)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="sekhar2004">Sekhar (2004)</span> compared the price volatility of different agricultural commodities in major Indian and international markets by using GARCH model. This model provided evidence on whether the estimated volatility is statistically significant or not. It also measures the persistence of volatility <span class="citation" data-cites="sabu2015">(Sabu 2015)</span>.</p>
<p>The ARCH process introduced by Engle (1982) explicitly recognizes the difference between the unconditional and the conditional variance allowing the latter to change over time as a function of past errors. The GARCH model of <span class="citation" data-cites="bollerslev1986">Bollerslev (1986)</span> is an important type of time series model for heteroscedastic data. It explicitly models a time-varying conditional variance as a linear function of past squared residuals and of its past values. GARCH models are an extension of the ARCH models first introduced by Engle (1982) as it basically introduces a lagged conditional variance to the information set of an ARCH model. An ARCH model applied to price volatility basically assumes that a dependent variable of commodity prices, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P_i">, is generated by the autoregressive process:</p>
<p><span id="eq-archmean"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p_i%20=%20%5Cphi_0%20+%20%5Csum_%7Bi=1%7D%5E%7Bk%7D%20%5Cphi_%7B1%7D%20P_%7Bt-1%7D%20+%20%5Cvarepsilon_t%20%5Ctag%7B1%7D"></span></p>
<p>To generate the ARCH<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(p)"> process, we express the conditional variance of the above expression as a function of its past values squared:</p>
<p><span id="eq-archdist"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cvarepsilon_t%20%5Cmid%20%5COmega_%7Bt-1%7D%20%5Csim%20N(0,%20h)%20%5Ctag%7B2%7D"></span></p>
<p><span id="eq-archvariance"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?h_t%5E2%20=%20%5Cdelta%20+%20%5Csum_%7Bi=1%7D%5E%7Bp%7D%20%5Calpha_i%20%5Cvarepsilon_%7Bt-i%7D%5E2%20%5Ctag%7B3%7D"></span></p>
<p>Where, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?h_t%5E2"> denotes the conditional variance of the information set <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5COmega_%7Bt-1%7D"> that is available at time <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t-1">, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdelta%20%3E%200">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Calpha_i%20%5Cgeq%200"> for all <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i%20=%202%20%5Cldots%20p"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Calpha_1%20+%20%5Calpha_2%20+%20%5Ccdots%20+%20%5Calpha_m%20%3C%201">, which are necessary to make <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cvarepsilon_t%5E2"> positive and covariance stationary.</p>
<p>The generalization of the ARCH process given in Equation&nbsp;3 is as follows <span class="citation" data-cites="bollerslev1986">(Bollerslev 1986)</span>:</p>
<p><span id="eq-archboller"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ah_t%5E2%20=%20%5Cdelta%20+%20%5Csum_%7Bi=1%7D%5E%7Bp%7D%20%5Calpha_i%20%5Cvarepsilon_%7Bt-i%7D%5E2%20+%20%5Csum_%7Bi=1%7D%5E%7Bq%7D%20%5Cbeta_i%20h_%7Bt-i%7D%5E2%0A%5Ctag%7B4%7D"></span></p>
<p>The GARCH model in Equation&nbsp;4 depicts the conditional variance of a price series to depend on a constant, past news about volatility (i.e.&nbsp;the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cvarepsilon_%7Bt-1%7D%5E2"> terms). Including the lagged conditional variances might capture the “adaptive learning” phenomenon. The benefit of the GARCH specification is that it contains fewer coefficient restrictions. For a well-defined variance and covariance function: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdelta,%20%5Calpha%20%3E%200;%20%5Cbeta%20%5Cgeq%200">, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Calpha%20+%20%5Cbeta%20%3C%201">.</p>
<p>Persistence of volatility in the commodity series is measured by the sum of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Calpha%20+%20%5Cbeta">. Downward price changes are often followed by higher volatility than upward movements of the same magnitude <span class="citation" data-cites="herrera2008">(Herrera and Espinel 2008)</span>.</p>
<p>Models aim to define volatility clustering and effects such as kurtosis, forming the basis of dynamic volatility models.</p>
<p>The key is that volatility, rather than remaining constant or moving in a monotonic manner over time, is dependent on past realisations of the associated volatility i.e.&nbsp;the error variance is related to the squared error terms over several periods in the past <span class="citation" data-cites="singh2020">(Singh 2020)</span>.</p>
<p>The ARCH-GARCH model was used to analyse the volatility and it was estimated using <code>R</code> software <span class="citation" data-cites="rcoreteam2023">(R Core Team 2023)</span>. From the different models, Standard GARCH (1,1) (SGARCH) model was identified as the best model for this study based on the smallest Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) values <span class="citation" data-cites="lestari2022">(Lestari et al. 2022)</span>. This model distinguishes the predictable and unpredictable components of prices and also allows the variance of the unpredictable element to be time-varying. Such time varying conditional variances were estimated by using the SGARCH (1,1) model <span class="citation" data-cites="gujarati2009">(Gujarati, Porter, and Gunasekhar 2009)</span> and it was used to identify periods of high volatility.</p>
<p>The GARCH(1,1) model is specified as:</p>
<p><span id="eq-garchmodel"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y_%7Bit%7D%20=%20%5Calpha_0%20+%20%5Cbeta_1%20P_%7Bt-1%7D%20+%20%5Cbeta_2%20P_%7Bt-2%7D%20+%20%5Cvarepsilon_t%20%5Cquad%20;%20%5Cquad%20t%20=%201,%202,%20%5Cldots,%20t%20%5Ctag%7B5%7D"></span></p>
<p><span id="eq-garchVariance"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma%5E2_%7Bi,t%7D%20=%20%5Ctheta%20+%20%5Calpha_i%20%5Cvarepsilon%5E2_%7Bi,t-1%7D%20+%20%5Cbeta_i%20%5Csigma%5E2_%7Bi,t-1%7D%20%5Ctag%7B6%7D"></span></p>
<p>Where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P_%7Bt-1%7D"> is the price at time <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t-1"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma%5E2_%7Bi,t%7D"> is the conditional error variance at time <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t">. The term <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(%5Calpha_i%20+%20%5Cbeta_i)"> indicates the degree of persistence in price volatility. If the sum <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(%5Calpha_i%20+%20%5Cbeta_i)"> is close to 1, it implies a high level of volatility persistence <span class="citation" data-cites="devi2015">(Devi, Srikala, and Ananda 2015)</span>.</p>
<p>The general form of a GARCH(<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?q">) model is:</p>
<p><span id="eq-garchpq"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma%5E2_%7Bi,t%7D%20=%20%5Comega%20+%20%5Csum_%7Bi=1%7D%5E%7Bp%7D%20%5Cbeta_i%20%5Csigma%5E2_%7Bt-i%7D%20+%20%5Csum_%7Bi=1%7D%5E%7Bq%7D%20%5Calpha_i%20%5Cvarepsilon%5E2_%7Bt-i%7D%20%5Ctag%7B7%7D"></span></p>

<p>In Vazhakulam, fresh pineapple is harvested at two stages: as green pineapple (harvested at 115 days after the ethephon application) and as ripe pineapple (harvested at 120–125 days after the ethephon application).</p>
<p>The present study analyzed the price volatility of both ripe and green pineapple using time series data of daily prices from January 2017 to September 2022. For analytical purposes, the data set was divided into the following three periods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pre-COVID period: January 2017 to March 2020<br>
</li>
<li>COVID–Post-COVID period: April 2020 to September 2022</li>
</ul>
<p>The average monthly prices of both green and ripe pineapple during the pre-COVID and COVID–post-COVID periods are presented in Figure&nbsp;1 (a) and Figure&nbsp;1 (b), respectively.</p>

Figure&nbsp;1: Average monthly prices (Rs./kg) of both green and ripe pineapple in Vazhakulam market during pre-covid and post-covid periods
</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Price of pineapple usually stood high during the summer months of April and May coinciding with summer and one-month long Ramdan fasting. So, many farmers targeted the harvest of the crop during these months. But in April 2020, during the first lockdown period due to strict restrictions, many pineapple plantations were abandoned without harvesting. This was mainly due to the unavailability of migrant labours (as they went back to their hometown fearing the disease). So, a steep decline in price was observed during that period. Prices started increasing as the restrictions were lifted gradually. Again in 2021, there was price drop in the months of May and June due to another lockdown and restrictions.</p>
<p>The price drop was to the level of Rs. 10/kg, which put farmers in distress. During the survey, many farmers reported that the price of pineapple had even dipped to Rs. 5/kg during the COVID period as they were not able to transport the produce to the Vazhakulam pineapple market. So, they sold produce in nearby markets. Many of the plantations were kept unharvested and harvested fruits fetched only very low price. Restrictions in interstate and intra state transport, fear of spread of virus through the fruits etc. worsened the situation. Many farmers terminated their lease contracts with landowners before expiry due to financial crisis and were unable to pay the lease amount and continue farming operations. Farmers reported that the reduction in the cultivated area had impacted total pineapple production from Vazhakulam. As the restrictions were gradually lifted towards the end of 2021, situation became normal and price hike was observed due to a reduced supply of pineapple to the market, with the demand for pineapple was same as earlier.</p>

<p>The results showed that the GARCH(1,1) model estimates for ripe and green pineapple prices were significant for the pre-COVID, COVID and post-COVID, and overall periods. It indicated that the volatility in the prices of pineapple was persistent despite the COVID-induced lockdown.</p>
<p>It is evident from Table&nbsp;1 that the sum of coefficients <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Calpha"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbeta"> for the prices of ripe pineapple was higher in the COVID-post-COVID period, followed by the overall period. This indicated higher volatility in the prices of ripe pineapple during the COVID-post-COVID period. A similar trend was observed in the price of green pineapple (Table&nbsp;2). This might be related to the reduced demand for pineapple in the market as a result of changes in the consumption behaviour of people during the pandemic. A study conducted by <span class="citation" data-cites="yu2020">Yu et al. (2020)</span> on the impact of COVID-19 on the prices of major food products in China found that rice and wheat showed no significant changes in prices after the COVID lockdown, whereas prices of cabbage showed higher volatility.</p>
<p>Among the green and ripe pineapple prices, higher volatility was observed in the prices of green pineapple as compared to ripe pineapple for all the periods—pre-COVID, COVID-post-COVID, and overall. The value of the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Calpha%20+%20%5Cbeta"> term for green pineapple prices was close to one (0.916) during the post-COVID period, which indicated higher volatility in the prices of green pineapple after the lockdown. This could be because the effect of transportation restrictions during the lockdown on green pineapple was greater as it was marketed to North India, whereas mature ripe pineapple was marketed in Kerala and nearby states. In a similar attempt, while studying the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the prices of rice, chilli, and garlic in Indonesia, it was found that due to the government’s different social assistance programs, the impact of COVID-19 on the prices of rice was negligible, whereas the prices of chilli and garlic had decreased due to the pandemic. The study also found that the effect of COVID-19 on the prices of horticultural products was higher as compared to that on the prices of food grains <span class="citation" data-cites="zahraturrahmi2021">(Zahraturrahmi et al. 2021)</span>.</p>

<p>The Figure&nbsp;2 indicated that there was volatility in the prices of pineapple. But the volatility was more prominent during the COVID-post-COVID period. A lowest price of Rs.10 per kg was realized during the COVID period and it recovered gradually to Rs.60 per kg during the post-COVID period. According to Pineapple Growers Association Kerala, the farm gate price had come down to Rs.10 per kg compared to Rs.40 in the previous year due to lockdown <span class="citation" data-cites="kumar2020">(Kumar 2020)</span>. Thus, the pineapple farmers were in distress and they were unable to pay off their debts. There was also a report of farmer suicide due to financial losses in pineapple cultivation <span class="citation" data-cites="gok2020b">(Government of Kerala 2020b)</span>.</p>
<p>In a similar attempt, <span class="citation" data-cites="kaur2021">(Kaur 2021)</span> in her study observed persistence of volatility in the prices of cereals, pulses and fruits before and after COVID-19. <span class="citation" data-cites="arumugam2020">(Arumugam, Kanagavalli, and Manida 2020)</span> revealed that the problem of labour shortage caused by a fear of viral transmission led to the wastage of harvested commodities, primarily fruits and vegetables, and also demand reduction of produce in the market. In a study conducted by <span class="citation" data-cites="pandya2021">(Pandya et al. 2021)</span>, the prices of all agricultural items dropped by about 70 percent due to a rapid drop in demand and an excess supply of farm products. According to <span class="citation" data-cites="hossain2020">(Hossain et al. 2020)</span>, COVID-19 not only affected physical health but also affected the mental health of farmers.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>The present study highlights the significant volatility in pineapple prices across pre-COVID, COVID-post-COVID, and overall periods in the Vazhakulam market. Results from the GARCH(1,1) model indicated that both green and ripe pineapple prices experienced persistent volatility, with a pronounced increase during the COVID-post-COVID period. This was evident from the higher <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Calpha%20+%20%5Cbeta"> values observed, especially for green pineapple, suggesting a strong memory in the price volatility process during this period.</p>
<p>Several factors contributed to this heightened volatility. The COVID lockdowns imposed transport and logistics constraints and disrupted supply chains which caused a temporary collapse in market demand. This was reflected in steep price drops, with the price of pineapple falling as low as Rs 10 per kg during the lockdown, as reported by the Pineapple Growers Association <span class="citation" data-cites="kumar2020">(Kumar 2020)</span>. The inability to harvest or transport produce due to labour shortages further aggravated the situation <span class="citation" data-cites="arumugam2020">(Arumugam, Kanagavalli, and Manida 2020)</span>.</p>
<p>The findings are consistent with similar studies on other horticultural commodities. <span class="citation" data-cites="kaur2021">(Kaur 2021)</span> found continued volatility in food prices post-COVID, and <span class="citation" data-cites="pandya2021">(Pandya et al. 2021)</span> noted an average price drop of 70% in farm produce during the early pandemic phase. Moreover, the psychological and financial stress induced by the pandemic led to cases of farmer distress and suicide, further underlining the socioeconomic impact <span class="citation" data-cites="hossain2020">(Hossain et al. 2020)</span>.</p>
<p>It was also evident that green pineapple prices were more volatile than ripe ones, potentially due to their greater dependence on inter-state transport, especially to North Indian markets. These insights underscore the vulnerability of perishable commodity sectors to external shocks and reinforce the need for effective price risk management, timely market intelligence, and supportive agricultural policy interventions.</p>

<section id="conclusion" class="level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Pineapple cultivation remains a remunerative agricultural activity for many farmers in Kerala, particularly because it is one of the major fruit crops transported from the state to other parts of India. This study examined the price volatility in the Vazhakulam pineapple market during the pre-COVID, COVID-post-COVID, and overall periods. Findings revealed that pineapple farmers in Kerala have historically faced frequent price fluctuations, with significantly heightened volatility observed during the COVID-post-COVID period. This increase was primarily attributed to transportation restrictions and a fall in market demand due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>These results have important implications for policymakers. To stabilize the pineapple market, there is a need to develop more robust price risk management mechanisms. Although the Government of Kerala has fixed a base price of Rs 15 per kg for pineapple <span class="citation" data-cites="gok2020b">(Government of Kerala 2020b)</span>, the study found the average cost of production to be Rs 17.33 per kg. Therefore, it is recommended that the base price be revised to at least Rs 20–22 per kg to ensure profitability. The findings highlight the need for targeted policy support and risk management strategies to stabilize pineapple marketsin Kerala and protect farmer livelihoods during times of crisis.</p>

<h2 data-number="1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>The yardlong bean is one of the most important leguminous vegetables in Asia. Also known as the asparagus bean, string bean, snake bean, or snake pea, it was originally cultivated in West Africa and is now widely grown throughout Southeast Asia—including Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand—where it can be cultivated year-round. In India, it has been known since Vedic times <span class="citation" data-cites="benchasri2012evaluation">(Benchasri, Bairaman, and Nualsri 2012)</span>.</p>
<p>Typically harvested while still young, the yardlong bean is consumed as a green vegetable. It is an annual plant characterized by rapid growth, especially when supported by a trellis. Both tall and short climbing types exist. A member of the Fabaceae family, the plant features twining, delicate stems with a tenacious root system. It blooms in mid-summer, producing pairs of large white or purple flowers. Once pollinated, these flowers develop into slender, dark green beans that can grow up to 12 inches in just a few days. Mature beans can reach lengths of up to three feet, turning pale green and swelling as the red or black seeds ripen.</p>
<p>The yardlong bean also contributes to soil fertility by fixing atmospheric nitrogen through nodules on its roots. It is often referred to as the “poor man’s meat” because its pods are not only rich in protein (23–32% of seed weight) but also contain essential amino acids like lysine and tryptophan, as well as significant levels of folic acid, vitamin B, and other critical micronutrients <span class="citation" data-cites="peyrano2016physicochemical">(Peyrano, Speroni, and Avanza 2016)</span>. As such, it serves as a key dietary staple for many of the poorest populations in developing countries.</p>
<p>Despite its nutritional and agricultural importance, relatively little breeding work has been conducted on this crop. The development of high-yielding, stress-tolerant varieties could significantly boost its cultivation and productivity. However, as a predominantly self-pollinated crop, studies on gene action in yardlong bean remain limited. This study aims to identify gene action governing yield-related traits, which will help inform new breeding strategies to enhance crop improvement efforts.</p>

<h2 data-number="2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="materials-and-methods"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Materials and methods</h2>
<p>The genetic material used in the present study consisted of hybrid (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F_1">) plants derived from three promising crosses, along with their six respective parents. The selected parental inbred lines were chosen based solely on differences in yield-related traits. Three single-cross <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F_1"> hybrids were developed using parents with contrasting characteristics.</p>
<p>The three most promising hybrids, based on yield performance and disease resistance from a previous study, were selected for further evaluation. The <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F_1"> hybrids were backcrossed to their respective parents to generate backcross (BC) generations. Simultaneously, the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F_1"> hybrids were self-pollinated to produce the corresponding <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F_2"> populations.</p>
<p>Generation mean analysis was conducted using eighteen populations in total: the three <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F_1">s, their six parents, six backcross generations, and three <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F_2"> populations. The experiment was laid out in a randomized block design (RBD) with three replications in the College of Agriculture, Vellayani during Summer 2004. Standard crop management practices were followed throughout the study. Observations on yield and yield-related traits were recorded from 10 plants each for the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F_1">, parent, and backcross generations. For the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F_2"> populations, data were collected from 30 plants per cross.</p>

<p>The six-parameter model developed by Hayman <span class="citation" data-cites="hayman1958separation">(Hayman 1958)</span> was used for generation mean analysis.

<p>Generation mean analysis is a statistical technique used to estimate the components of variance and determine the predominant type of gene action controlling important traits in a crop species. This analysis assists in selecting appropriate breeding strategies for the improvement of various quantitative traits.</p>
<p>Generation mean analysis was conducted for three cowpea crosses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cross 1: VS86 × VS132<br>
</li>
<li>Cross 2: Kozhicode Local-2 × Thiruvananthapuram Local-12<br>
</li>
<li>Cross 3: Thiruvananthapuram Local-9 × Thiruvananthapuram Local-12</li>
</ul>
<p>The mean values of the six generations (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P_1">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P_2">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F_1">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F_2">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B_1">, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B_2">) for each cross are presented in Table&nbsp;1. Among them, the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F_1"> of Cross 3 flowered the earliest (38.4 days), while Cross 1 was harvested the earliest (58.1 days). The <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F_1"> of Cross 2 exhibited the highest pod yield per plant (454.91 g), whereas the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B_2"> generation of Cross 1 recorded the maximum yield overall (485.67 g).</p>
<p>The scale values and genetic component estimates for the various traits across the three crosses are shown in Table&nbsp;2 and Table&nbsp;3. The estimated mean effect (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m">) was highly significant for traits such as days to flowering, pod length, pod breadth, pods per plant, pod yield per plant, and root weight across all crosses, indicating that these traits are quantitatively inherited.</p>
<p>As shown in Table&nbsp;3, significant negative dominant effects (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?h">) were observed for pod length and pod yield per plant, suggesting that these traits are more prominently expressed in homozygous individuals.</p>

<p>The significance of scales <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B"> for most traits indicates that the simple additive-dominance model is inadequate for explaining their inheritance, as reported by <span class="citation" data-cites="thakare2016genetic">Thakare et al. (2016)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="kudiabor2023gene">Kudiabor et al. (2023)</span>. Non-allelic interactions, alongside additive and dominance components, were observed in the expression of several traits, similar to the findings of <span class="citation" data-cites="edematie2021inheritance">Edematie et al. (2021)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="akombo2021">Akombo et al. (2021)</span>.</p>
<p>Significant additive × additive (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i">) interactions were found for pod length, pods per plant, pod yield per plant, and root weight, suggesting complementary or duplicate epistasis. Non-allelic interactions were also evident in traits like days to first flowering. Here, additive effects were highly significant, and additive × dominance (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j">) interactions were also observed. Dominance × dominance (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?l">) interactions acted in a favorable negative direction in all hybrids. Similar epistatic interactions for early flowering and duplicate epistasis for traits like days to 90% pod maturity in cowpea were reported by <span class="citation" data-cites="patel2013">Patel et al. (2013)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="thakare2016genetic">Thakare et al. (2016)</span>, and <span class="citation" data-cites="owusu2022generation">Owusu et al. (2022)</span>.</p>
<p>These findings imply that earliness in cowpea could be improved through hybridization followed by the selection of promising recombinants in later generations, particularly in crosses governed by duplicate epistasis.</p>
<p>The significance of scales <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D"> for pod length further supports the involvement of dominance × dominance and additive × additive interactions in this trait. Significant additive (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?d">) and dominance (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?h">) effects for pod length were also reported by <span class="citation" data-cites="rashwan2010estimation">Rashwan (2010)</span> and Thakare et al.&nbsp;(2013).</p>
<p>Among epistatic interactions, dominance × dominance (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?l">), additive × additive (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i">), and additive × dominance (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j">) were observed in different crosses. In the case of pod weight, both dominance effects and additive × additive interactions were significant but acted in a negative direction. However, the positive significance of dominance × dominance interactions suggests that hybridization followed by selection would be an effective strategy for improving this trait.</p>
<p>All three types of digenic interactions (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?l">) were observed for pods per plant. While additive × dominance (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j">) was positive and significant, both dominance (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?h">) and additive × additive (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i">) effects acted in the negative direction. The presence of non-allelic interactions for this trait aligns with the findings of <span class="citation" data-cites="thakare2016genetic">Thakare et al. (2016)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="edematie2021inheritance">Edematie et al. (2021)</span>. Significant positive dominance (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?h">) and dominance × dominance (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?l">) interactions suggest the presence of complementary epistasis. In contrast, the negative significance of dominance × dominance (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?l">) for pod yield per plant implies limited potential for improvement through heterosis breeding for this trait.</p>
<p>The direction of dominance and dominance × dominance interactions indicated duplicate gene action in the expression of traits such as pod weight, pod breadth, pods per cluster, seeds per pod, root weight per plant, and days to first harvest. Dominance was found to play a role in all traits, especially pod length, as reported by <span class="citation" data-cites="santos2024genetic">Santos et al. (2024)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="pallavi2019generation">Pallavi, Singh, and Chaudhary (2019)</span>.</p>
<p>Both additive × additive and dominance × dominance interactions were significant for root weight per plant, while the insignificance of all four scale tests (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D">) for traits like pod breadth, pods per cluster, seeds per pod, days to first harvest, primary branches per plant, and 100-seed weight indicates the adequacy of the additive-dominance model for these traits, and the absence of epistasis. Nonetheless, duplicate epistasis for most yield-related traits in cowpea was previously reported by <span class="citation" data-cites="shinde2021generation">Shinde et al. (2021)</span>.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The generation mean analysis conducted on three cowpea crosses revealed complex genetic control for several important agronomic traits. While the mean effect was highly significant for all key traits, indicating their quantitative nature, the inadequacy of the simple additive-dominance model—evidenced by significant scale tests and the presence of epistasis—highlights the role of non-allelic gene interactions in trait inheritance. Additive × additive, additive × dominance, and dominance × dominance interactions were frequently observed across traits such as pod length, pod yield per plant, pods per plant, and root weight. The predominance of duplicate and complementary epistasis suggests that hybridization followed by selection in segregating generations would be an effective breeding strategy for improving these traits.</p>
<p>Traits like pod breadth, seeds per pod, and 100-seed weight showed no significant epistasis, indicating that selection based on the additive-dominance model may suffice for their improvement. Conversely, traits influenced by significant non-additive gene actions, such as pod yield and pod weight, may benefit more from recombination breeding approaches. Overall, this study underscores the importance of understanding the underlying gene action for designing appropriate breeding strategies. The insights gained provide a valuable foundation for improving yield and related traits in cowpea through targeted hybridization and selection efforts.</p>

<p>Statistical analysis serves as the backbone of scientific research, especially in disciplines like agriculture, where field experiments, survey data, and observational studies generate complex datasets. Despite the increasing emphasis on data-driven decision-making in agricultural research, many students, early-career researchers, and practitioners find themselves at a disadvantage when it comes to performing rigorous statistical analyses. The process is often hindered by a combination of factors: the steep learning curve associated with programming languages such as R and Python, the fragmented nature of statistical learning resources, and the lack of user-friendly tools tailored to agricultural research contexts.</p>
<p>While R and Python are powerful, flexible, and widely adopted in academic and professional settings, their command-line interfaces and syntax-heavy operations can be challenging for those without formal training in statistics or computer programming. Beginners frequently struggle with package selection, data cleaning, model specification, and interpretation of results. Furthermore, existing statistical software either lacks the flexibility and transparency of open-source tools or comes with licensing restrictions and high costs that limit accessibility in resource-constrained settings, particularly in developing countries.</p>
<p>In addition, agricultural research involves domain-specific needs such as handling experimental designs (e.g., CRD, RBD, split-plot), analyzing agronomic trials, processing survey data with appropriate sampling designs, and interpreting interactions between multiple environmental and genetic factors. Traditional statistical packages are not always well-adapted to these specific requirements, leaving researchers to either customize solutions on their own or consult specialists — both of which can delay or compromise the analytical workflow.</p>
<p>To bridge this gap, we developed RAISINS (R and AI Solutions for INferential Statistics) — a web-based platform designed to simplify and democratize statistical analysis for agricultural research. RAISINS integrates the power of R, Python, and AI-driven assistance within an intuitive interface that eliminates the need for code-based interaction. By abstracting complex syntax and offering guided, step-by-step workflows for data upload, analysis, visualization, and interpretation, the platform empowers users to focus on scientific inquiry rather than technical execution.</p>
<p>Built on open-source technologies and scalable cloud infrastructure, RAISINS provides modules for commonly used statistical methods — including descriptive analysis, hypothesis testing, regression models, design of experiments, multi environmental trials, and more — while incorporating AI tools that assist in data summarization, analytical suggestions, and natural language explanations of results. This makes it an ideal solution for students, researchers, extension personnel, and educators engaged in agricultural and allied sciences. RAISINS can be accessed online through its official web portal at https://www.raisins.live/.</p>
<p>In this paper, we present the design, features, and use-cases of RAISINS, and demonstrate how it addresses the unique challenges faced in agricultural data analysis by offering an accessible, robust, and intelligent statistical platform.</p>
