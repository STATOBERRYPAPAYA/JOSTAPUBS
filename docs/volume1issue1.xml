<p>Price volatility is one of the significant sources of risk in agriculture especially in fruits and vegetable production. It is defined as the directionless fluctuations in prices that cannot be predicted with market fundamentals <span class="citation" data-cites="prakash2011">(Prakash 2011)</span>. Reasons for price volatility include supply-side shocks due to severe weather events or diseases, variations in demand, distortions in trade policies and supply chain disruptions <span class="citation" data-cites="gilbert2010 ait_sidhoum2016">(Gilbert and Morgan 2010; Ait Sidhoum and Serra 2016)</span>. The increasing unpredictability of changing economic and natural environment <span class="citation" data-cites="tothova2011">(Tothova 2011)</span> and seasonal nature of the fruits and vegetables also amplifies price volatility. Moreover, poor shelf life of horticulture crops increases risk and leads to unstable markets <span class="citation" data-cites="cook2011">(Cook 2011)</span>.</p>
<p>Vazhakulam in Ernakulam district has become the major hub for pineapple cultivation in Kerala <span class="citation" data-cites="joy2013">(Joy 2013)</span>. Owing to its unique feature Vazhakulam pineapple has got Geographical indication tag also. Pineapple produced from the region has a long value chain and is marketed to various states like Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Delhi mainly through road ways. Limited quantity of fresh pineapple is being exported to Gulf countries in special packings <span class="citation" data-cites="pga2018">(Pineapple Growers Association 2018)</span>.</p>
<p>Pineapple is a globally traded fruit crop from Kerala that had always been subject to price volatility. It is mainly because of the seasonal variations in demand for pineapple in markets. Climate change induced low production, seasonal disruptions in demand and supply are the main factors that affect price volatility. It was noted that the COVID induced lock down had severely affected the pineapple prices and farmer suicides were reported during the period. This pandemic had a significant negative impact on all sectors of human life, including the economy, food security and health <span class="citation" data-cites="saadat2020">(Saadat, Rawtani, and Hussain 2020)</span>. According to <span class="citation" data-cites="jribi2020">(Jribi et al. 2020)</span>, the pandemic had the potential to hinder the progress towards meeting several Sustainable Development Goals (United Nations SDG 2015-2030), in particular, SDG 2 (End Hunger) and SDG 12 (Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns). There were widespread disruptions in agriculture supply chain at the beginning of the lockdown <span class="citation" data-cites="fao2021">(FAO 2021)</span>. It further lead to the scarcity of labour, disrupted supply chains and lack of demand and logistics restrictions in the agricultural sector <span class="citation" data-cites="cariappa2021">(Cariappa et al. 2021)</span>.</p>
<p>Although the price volatility of different agricultural commodities has been researched extensively in recent periods <span class="citation" data-cites="gilbert2010 sabu2019 yu2020">(Gilbert and Morgan 2010; Sabu, Kuruvila, and Manojkumar 2019; Yu et al. 2020)</span>, a lack of knowledge exists in the pineapple sector of Kerala. The knowledge about the price risk and volatility associated with the pineapple sector is important for pineapple farmers during the pandemic. This information is critical for developing suitable price risk management strategies, for coping up with similar situations. Hence the present study aims to analyse the price behaviour of Pineapple in Kerala.</p>

<p>The study was conducted in Ernakulam district of Kerala. The study area was selected purposively as it has the largest area under pineapple cultivation in Kerala. Out of the total area under pineapple in Kerala, 58.73 per cent lies in Ernakulam district which produces about 63 per cent of the production of the state in the year <span class="citation" data-cites="gok2020a">(Government of Kerala 2020a)</span>. From the district, Muvattupuzha Block Panchayath was purposively selected based on the maximum area under pineapple cultivation. Three pineapple-growing grama panchayats viz., Avoly, Manjalloor, and Kalloorkkad were selected from the block panchayat randomly. Forty farmers each were randomly selected from these grama panchayaths making a total sample size of 120 farmers.</p>

<h3 data-number="2.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sampling-and-data-collection"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Sampling and data collection</h3>
<p>The study used time series data of daily prices of pineapple from January 2017 to September 2022 collected from Vazhakulam Pineapple Growers Association(PGA). Price collected can be aptly considered as representative price as most of the pineapple farmers are organized under PGA and trade pineapple through them. The prices represent the farm gate price received by the farmers and it is easily available in the website of Pineapple Growers Association<span class="citation" data-cites="pga2018">(Pineapple Growers Association 2018)</span>. Data on daily prices of pineapple from January 2017 to March 2020 was taken as pre-COVID period and from April 2020 to September 2022 is taken as COVID-post-COVID period. January 2017 to September 2022 was taken as the overall period.</p>

<h3 data-number="2.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="garch-models"><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> GARCH models</h3>
<p>The uncertainty surrounding prospective price fluctuation is referred to as volatility. There are different methods to estimate volatility such as historical moving average, Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA), Auto Regressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (ARCH) introduced by <span class="citation" data-cites="engle1982">Engle (1982)</span> and Generalized Auto-Regressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) introduced by <span class="citation" data-cites="bollerslev1986">Bollerslev (1986)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="sekhar2004">Sekhar (2004)</span> compared the price volatility of different agricultural commodities in major Indian and international markets by using GARCH model. This model provided evidence on whether the estimated volatility is statistically significant or not. It also measures the persistence of volatility <span class="citation" data-cites="sabu2015">(Sabu 2015)</span>.</p>
<p>The ARCH process introduced by Engle (1982) explicitly recognizes the difference between the unconditional and the conditional variance allowing the latter to change over time as a function of past errors. The GARCH model of <span class="citation" data-cites="bollerslev1986">Bollerslev (1986)</span> is an important type of time series model for heteroscedastic data. It explicitly models a time-varying conditional variance as a linear function of past squared residuals and of its past values. GARCH models are an extension of the ARCH models first introduced by Engle (1982) as it basically introduces a lagged conditional variance to the information set of an ARCH model. An ARCH model applied to price volatility basically assumes that a dependent variable of commodity prices, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P_i">, is generated by the autoregressive process:</p>
<p><span id="eq-archmean"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p_i%20=%20%5Cphi_0%20+%20%5Csum_%7Bi=1%7D%5E%7Bk%7D%20%5Cphi_%7B1%7D%20P_%7Bt-1%7D%20+%20%5Cvarepsilon_t%20%5Ctag%7B1%7D"></span></p>
<p>To generate the ARCH<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(p)"> process, we express the conditional variance of the above expression as a function of its past values squared:</p>
<p><span id="eq-archdist"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cvarepsilon_t%20%5Cmid%20%5COmega_%7Bt-1%7D%20%5Csim%20N(0,%20h)%20%5Ctag%7B2%7D"></span></p>
<p><span id="eq-archvariance"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?h_t%5E2%20=%20%5Cdelta%20+%20%5Csum_%7Bi=1%7D%5E%7Bp%7D%20%5Calpha_i%20%5Cvarepsilon_%7Bt-i%7D%5E2%20%5Ctag%7B3%7D"></span></p>
<p>Where, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?h_t%5E2"> denotes the conditional variance of the information set <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5COmega_%7Bt-1%7D"> that is available at time <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t-1">, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdelta%20%3E%200">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Calpha_i%20%5Cgeq%200"> for all <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i%20=%202%20%5Cldots%20p"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Calpha_1%20+%20%5Calpha_2%20+%20%5Ccdots%20+%20%5Calpha_m%20%3C%201">, which are necessary to make <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cvarepsilon_t%5E2"> positive and covariance stationary.</p>
<p>The generalization of the ARCH process given in Equation&nbsp;3 is as follows <span class="citation" data-cites="bollerslev1986">(Bollerslev 1986)</span>:</p>
<p><span id="eq-archboller"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ah_t%5E2%20=%20%5Cdelta%20+%20%5Csum_%7Bi=1%7D%5E%7Bp%7D%20%5Calpha_i%20%5Cvarepsilon_%7Bt-i%7D%5E2%20+%20%5Csum_%7Bi=1%7D%5E%7Bq%7D%20%5Cbeta_i%20h_%7Bt-i%7D%5E2%0A%5Ctag%7B4%7D"></span></p>
<p>The GARCH model in Equation&nbsp;4 depicts the conditional variance of a price series to depend on a constant, past news about volatility (i.e.&nbsp;the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cvarepsilon_%7Bt-1%7D%5E2"> terms). Including the lagged conditional variances might capture the “adaptive learning” phenomenon. The benefit of the GARCH specification is that it contains fewer coefficient restrictions. For a well-defined variance and covariance function: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdelta,%20%5Calpha%20%3E%200;%20%5Cbeta%20%5Cgeq%200">, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Calpha%20+%20%5Cbeta%20%3C%201">.</p>
<p>Persistence of volatility in the commodity series is measured by the sum of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Calpha%20+%20%5Cbeta">. Downward price changes are often followed by higher volatility than upward movements of the same magnitude <span class="citation" data-cites="herrera2008">(Herrera and Espinel 2008)</span>.</p>
<p>Models aim to define volatility clustering and effects such as kurtosis, forming the basis of dynamic volatility models.</p>
<p>The key is that volatility, rather than remaining constant or moving in a monotonic manner over time, is dependent on past realisations of the associated volatility i.e.&nbsp;the error variance is related to the squared error terms over several periods in the past <span class="citation" data-cites="singh2020">(Singh 2020)</span>.</p>
<p>The ARCH-GARCH model was used to analyse the volatility and it was estimated using <code>R</code> software <span class="citation" data-cites="rcoreteam2023">(R Core Team 2023)</span>. From the different models, Standard GARCH (1,1) (SGARCH) model was identified as the best model for this study based on the smallest Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) values <span class="citation" data-cites="lestari2022">(Lestari et al. 2022)</span>. This model distinguishes the predictable and unpredictable components of prices and also allows the variance of the unpredictable element to be time-varying. Such time varying conditional variances were estimated by using the SGARCH (1,1) model <span class="citation" data-cites="gujarati2009">(Gujarati, Porter, and Gunasekhar 2009)</span> and it was used to identify periods of high volatility.</p>
<p>The GARCH(1,1) model is specified as:</p>
<p><span id="eq-garchmodel"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y_%7Bit%7D%20=%20%5Calpha_0%20+%20%5Cbeta_1%20P_%7Bt-1%7D%20+%20%5Cbeta_2%20P_%7Bt-2%7D%20+%20%5Cvarepsilon_t%20%5Cquad%20;%20%5Cquad%20t%20=%201,%202,%20%5Cldots,%20t%20%5Ctag%7B5%7D"></span></p>
<p><span id="eq-garchVariance"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma%5E2_%7Bi,t%7D%20=%20%5Ctheta%20+%20%5Calpha_i%20%5Cvarepsilon%5E2_%7Bi,t-1%7D%20+%20%5Cbeta_i%20%5Csigma%5E2_%7Bi,t-1%7D%20%5Ctag%7B6%7D"></span></p>
<p>Where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P_%7Bt-1%7D"> is the price at time <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t-1"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma%5E2_%7Bi,t%7D"> is the conditional error variance at time <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t">. The term <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(%5Calpha_i%20+%20%5Cbeta_i)"> indicates the degree of persistence in price volatility. If the sum <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(%5Calpha_i%20+%20%5Cbeta_i)"> is close to 1, it implies a high level of volatility persistence <span class="citation" data-cites="devi2015">(Devi, Srikala, and Ananda 2015)</span>.</p>
<p>The general form of a GARCH(<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?q">) model is:</p>
<p><span id="eq-garchpq"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma%5E2_%7Bi,t%7D%20=%20%5Comega%20+%20%5Csum_%7Bi=1%7D%5E%7Bp%7D%20%5Cbeta_i%20%5Csigma%5E2_%7Bt-i%7D%20+%20%5Csum_%7Bi=1%7D%5E%7Bq%7D%20%5Calpha_i%20%5Cvarepsilon%5E2_%7Bt-i%7D%20%5Ctag%7B7%7D"></span></p>

<p>In Vazhakulam, fresh pineapple is harvested at two stages: as green pineapple (harvested at 115 days after the ethephon application) and as ripe pineapple (harvested at 120–125 days after the ethephon application).</p>
<p>The present study analyzed the price volatility of both ripe and green pineapple using time series data of daily prices from January 2017 to September 2022. For analytical purposes, the data set was divided into the following three periods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pre-COVID period: January 2017 to March 2020<br>
</li>
<li>COVID–Post-COVID period: April 2020 to September 2022</li>
</ul>
<p>The average monthly prices of both green and ripe pineapple during the pre-COVID and COVID–post-COVID periods are presented in Figure&nbsp;1 (a) and Figure&nbsp;1 (b), respectively.</p>

<p>Price of pineapple usually stood high during the summer months of April and May coinciding with summer and one-month long Ramdan fasting. So, many farmers targeted the harvest of the crop during these months. But in April 2020, during the first lockdown period due to strict restrictions, many pineapple plantations were abandoned without harvesting. This was mainly due to the unavailability of migrant labours (as they went back to their hometown fearing the disease). So, a steep decline in price was observed during that period. Prices started increasing as the restrictions were lifted gradually. Again in 2021, there was price drop in the months of May and June due to another lockdown and restrictions.</p>
<p>The price drop was to the level of Rs. 10/kg, which put farmers in distress. During the survey, many farmers reported that the price of pineapple had even dipped to Rs. 5/kg during the COVID period as they were not able to transport the produce to the Vazhakulam pineapple market. So, they sold produce in nearby markets. Many of the plantations were kept unharvested and harvested fruits fetched only very low price. Restrictions in interstate and intra state transport, fear of spread of virus through the fruits etc. worsened the situation. Many farmers terminated their lease contracts with landowners before expiry due to financial crisis and were unable to pay the lease amount and continue farming operations. Farmers reported that the reduction in the cultivated area had impacted total pineapple production from Vazhakulam. As the restrictions were gradually lifted towards the end of 2021, situation became normal and price hike was observed due to a reduced supply of pineapple to the market, with the demand for pineapple was same as earlier.</p>

<p>The results showed that the GARCH(1,1) model estimates for ripe and green pineapple prices were significant for the pre-COVID, COVID and post-COVID, and overall periods. It indicated that the volatility in the prices of pineapple was persistent despite the COVID-induced lockdown.</p>
<p>It is evident from Table&nbsp;1 that the sum of coefficients <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Calpha"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbeta"> for the prices of ripe pineapple was higher in the COVID-post-COVID period, followed by the overall period. This indicated higher volatility in the prices of ripe pineapple during the COVID-post-COVID period. A similar trend was observed in the price of green pineapple (Table&nbsp;2). This might be related to the reduced demand for pineapple in the market as a result of changes in the consumption behaviour of people during the pandemic. A study conducted by <span class="citation" data-cites="yu2020">Yu et al. (2020)</span> on the impact of COVID-19 on the prices of major food products in China found that rice and wheat showed no significant changes in prices after the COVID lockdown, whereas prices of cabbage showed higher volatility.</p>
<p>Among the green and ripe pineapple prices, higher volatility was observed in the prices of green pineapple as compared to ripe pineapple for all the periods—pre-COVID, COVID-post-COVID, and overall. The value of the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Calpha%20+%20%5Cbeta"> term for green pineapple prices was close to one (0.916) during the post-COVID period, which indicated higher volatility in the prices of green pineapple after the lockdown. This could be because the effect of transportation restrictions during the lockdown on green pineapple was greater as it was marketed to North India, whereas mature ripe pineapple was marketed in Kerala and nearby states. In a similar attempt, while studying the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the prices of rice, chilli, and garlic in Indonesia, it was found that due to the government’s different social assistance programs, the impact of COVID-19 on the prices of rice was negligible, whereas the prices of chilli and garlic had decreased due to the pandemic. The study also found that the effect of COVID-19 on the prices of horticultural products was higher as compared to that on the prices of food grains <span class="citation" data-cites="zahraturrahmi2021">(Zahraturrahmi et al. 2021)</span>.</p>

<p>The Figure&nbsp;2 indicated that there was volatility in the prices of pineapple. But the volatility was more prominent during the COVID-post-COVID period. A lowest price of Rs.10 per kg was realized during the COVID period and it recovered gradually to Rs.60 per kg during the post-COVID period. According to Pineapple Growers Association Kerala, the farm gate price had come down to Rs.10 per kg compared to Rs.40 in the previous year due to lockdown <span class="citation" data-cites="kumar2020">(Kumar 2020)</span>. Thus, the pineapple farmers were in distress and they were unable to pay off their debts. There was also a report of farmer suicide due to financial losses in pineapple cultivation <span class="citation" data-cites="gok2020b">(Government of Kerala 2020b)</span>.</p>
<p>In a similar attempt, <span class="citation" data-cites="kaur2021">(Kaur 2021)</span> in her study observed persistence of volatility in the prices of cereals, pulses and fruits before and after COVID-19. <span class="citation" data-cites="arumugam2020">(Arumugam, Kanagavalli, and Manida 2020)</span> revealed that the problem of labour shortage caused by a fear of viral transmission led to the wastage of harvested commodities, primarily fruits and vegetables, and also demand reduction of produce in the market. In a study conducted by <span class="citation" data-cites="pandya2021">(Pandya et al. 2021)</span>, the prices of all agricultural items dropped by about 70 percent due to a rapid drop in demand and an excess supply of farm products. According to <span class="citation" data-cites="hossain2020">(Hossain et al. 2020)</span>, COVID-19 not only affected physical health but also affected the mental health of farmers.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>The present study highlights the significant volatility in pineapple prices across pre-COVID, COVID-post-COVID, and overall periods in the Vazhakulam market. Results from the GARCH(1,1) model indicated that both green and ripe pineapple prices experienced persistent volatility, with a pronounced increase during the COVID-post-COVID period. This was evident from the higher <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Calpha%20+%20%5Cbeta"> values observed, especially for green pineapple, suggesting a strong memory in the price volatility process during this period.</p>
<p>Several factors contributed to this heightened volatility. The COVID lockdowns imposed transport and logistics constraints and disrupted supply chains which caused a temporary collapse in market demand. This was reflected in steep price drops, with the price of pineapple falling as low as Rs 10 per kg during the lockdown, as reported by the Pineapple Growers Association <span class="citation" data-cites="kumar2020">(Kumar 2020)</span>. The inability to harvest or transport produce due to labour shortages further aggravated the situation <span class="citation" data-cites="arumugam2020">(Arumugam, Kanagavalli, and Manida 2020)</span>.</p>
<p>The findings are consistent with similar studies on other horticultural commodities. <span class="citation" data-cites="kaur2021">(Kaur 2021)</span> found continued volatility in food prices post-COVID, and <span class="citation" data-cites="pandya2021">(Pandya et al. 2021)</span> noted an average price drop of 70% in farm produce during the early pandemic phase. Moreover, the psychological and financial stress induced by the pandemic led to cases of farmer distress and suicide, further underlining the socioeconomic impact <span class="citation" data-cites="hossain2020">(Hossain et al. 2020)</span>.</p>
<p>It was also evident that green pineapple prices were more volatile than ripe ones, potentially due to their greater dependence on inter-state transport, especially to North Indian markets. These insights underscore the vulnerability of perishable commodity sectors to external shocks and reinforce the need for effective price risk management, timely market intelligence, and supportive agricultural policy interventions.</p>

<section id="conclusion" class="level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Pineapple cultivation remains a remunerative agricultural activity for many farmers in Kerala, particularly because it is one of the major fruit crops transported from the state to other parts of India. This study examined the price volatility in the Vazhakulam pineapple market during the pre-COVID, COVID-post-COVID, and overall periods. Findings revealed that pineapple farmers in Kerala have historically faced frequent price fluctuations, with significantly heightened volatility observed during the COVID-post-COVID period. This increase was primarily attributed to transportation restrictions and a fall in market demand due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>These results have important implications for policymakers. To stabilize the pineapple market, there is a need to develop more robust price risk management mechanisms. Although the Government of Kerala has fixed a base price of Rs 15 per kg for pineapple <span class="citation" data-cites="gok2020b">(Government of Kerala 2020b)</span>, the study found the average cost of production to be Rs 17.33 per kg. Therefore, it is recommended that the base price be revised to at least Rs 20–22 per kg to ensure profitability. The findings highlight the need for targeted policy support and risk management strategies to stabilize pineapple marketsin Kerala and protect farmer livelihoods during times of crisis.</p>

<h2 data-number="1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>The yardlong bean is one of the most important leguminous vegetables in Asia. Also known as the asparagus bean, string bean, snake bean, or snake pea, it was originally cultivated in West Africa and is now widely grown throughout Southeast Asia—including Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand—where it can be cultivated year-round. In India, it has been known since Vedic times <span class="citation" data-cites="benchasri2012evaluation">(Benchasri, Bairaman, and Nualsri 2012)</span>.</p>
<p>Typically harvested while still young, the yardlong bean is consumed as a green vegetable. It is an annual plant characterized by rapid growth, especially when supported by a trellis. Both tall and short climbing types exist. A member of the Fabaceae family, the plant features twining, delicate stems with a tenacious root system. It blooms in mid-summer, producing pairs of large white or purple flowers. Once pollinated, these flowers develop into slender, dark green beans that can grow up to 12 inches in just a few days. Mature beans can reach lengths of up to three feet, turning pale green and swelling as the red or black seeds ripen.</p>
<p>The yardlong bean also contributes to soil fertility by fixing atmospheric nitrogen through nodules on its roots. It is often referred to as the “poor man’s meat” because its pods are not only rich in protein (23–32% of seed weight) but also contain essential amino acids like lysine and tryptophan, as well as significant levels of folic acid, vitamin B, and other critical micronutrients <span class="citation" data-cites="peyrano2016physicochemical">(Peyrano, Speroni, and Avanza 2016)</span>. As such, it serves as a key dietary staple for many of the poorest populations in developing countries.</p>
<p>Despite its nutritional and agricultural importance, relatively little breeding work has been conducted on this crop. The development of high-yielding, stress-tolerant varieties could significantly boost its cultivation and productivity. However, as a predominantly self-pollinated crop, studies on gene action in yardlong bean remain limited. This study aims to identify gene action governing yield-related traits, which will help inform new breeding strategies to enhance crop improvement efforts.</p>

<p>The genetic material used in the present study consisted of hybrid (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F_1">) plants derived from three promising crosses, along with their six respective parents. The selected parental inbred lines were chosen based solely on differences in yield-related traits. Three single-cross <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F_1"> hybrids were developed using parents with contrasting characteristics.</p>
<p>The three most promising hybrids, based on yield performance and disease resistance from a previous study, were selected for further evaluation. The <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F_1"> hybrids were backcrossed to their respective parents to generate backcross (BC) generations. Simultaneously, the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F_1"> hybrids were self-pollinated to produce the corresponding <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F_2"> populations.</p>
<p>Generation mean analysis was conducted using eighteen populations in total: the three <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F_1">s, their six parents, six backcross generations, and three <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F_2"> populations. The experiment was laid out in a randomized block design (RBD) with three replications in the College of Agriculture, Vellayani during Summer 2004. Standard crop management practices were followed throughout the study. Observations on yield and yield-related traits were recorded from 10 plants each for the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F_1">, parent, and backcross generations. For the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F_2"> populations, data were collected from 30 plants per cross.</p>

<p>The six-parameter model developed by Hayman <span class="citation" data-cites="hayman1958separation">(Hayman 1958)</span> was used for generation mean analysis. The four scaling tests (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C">, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D">) were determined according to the method suggested by Mather <span class="citation" data-cites="mather1949biometrical">(Mather 1949)</span>. These different scales are computed using simple linear combinations as given in Equation&nbsp;1 to Equation&nbsp;4.</p>

<p>Generation mean analysis is a statistical technique used to estimate the components of variance and determine the predominant type of gene action controlling important traits in a crop species. This analysis assists in selecting appropriate breeding strategies for the improvement of various quantitative traits.</p>
<p>Generation mean analysis was conducted for three cowpea crosses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cross 1: VS86 × VS132<br>
</li>
<li>Cross 2: Kozhicode Local-2 × Thiruvananthapuram Local-12<br>
</li>
<li>Cross 3: Thiruvananthapuram Local-9 × Thiruvananthapuram Local-12</li>
</ul>
<p>The mean values of the six generations (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P_1">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P_2">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F_1">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F_2">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B_1">, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B_2">) for each cross are presented in Table&nbsp;1. Among them, the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F_1"> of Cross 3 flowered the earliest (38.4 days), while Cross 1 was harvested the earliest (58.1 days). The <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F_1"> of Cross 2 exhibited the highest pod yield per plant (454.91 g), whereas the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B_2"> generation of Cross 1 recorded the maximum yield overall (485.67 g).</p>
<p>The scale values and genetic component estimates for the various traits across the three crosses are shown in Table&nbsp;2 and Table&nbsp;3. The estimated mean effect (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m">) was highly significant for traits such as days to flowering, pod length, pod breadth, pods per plant, pod yield per plant, and root weight across all crosses, indicating that these traits are quantitatively inherited.</p>
<p>As shown in Table&nbsp;3, significant negative dominant effects (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?h">) were observed for pod length and pod yield per plant, suggesting that these traits are more prominently expressed in homozygous individuals.</p>

<p>The significance of scales <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B"> for most traits indicates that the simple additive-dominance model is inadequate for explaining their inheritance, as reported by <span class="citation" data-cites="thakare2016genetic">Thakare et al. (2016)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="kudiabor2023gene">Kudiabor et al. (2023)</span>. Non-allelic interactions, alongside additive and dominance components, were observed in the expression of several traits, similar to the findings of <span class="citation" data-cites="edematie2021inheritance">Edematie et al. (2021)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="akombo2021">Akombo et al. (2021)</span>.</p>
<p>Significant additive × additive (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i">) interactions were found for pod length, pods per plant, pod yield per plant, and root weight, suggesting complementary or duplicate epistasis. Non-allelic interactions were also evident in traits like days to first flowering. Here, additive effects were highly significant, and additive × dominance (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j">) interactions were also observed. Dominance × dominance (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?l">) interactions acted in a favorable negative direction in all hybrids. Similar epistatic interactions for early flowering and duplicate epistasis for traits like days to 90% pod maturity in cowpea were reported by <span class="citation" data-cites="patel2013">Patel et al. (2013)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="thakare2016genetic">Thakare et al. (2016)</span>, and <span class="citation" data-cites="owusu2022generation">Owusu et al. (2022)</span>.</p>
<p>These findings imply that earliness in cowpea could be improved through hybridization followed by the selection of promising recombinants in later generations, particularly in crosses governed by duplicate epistasis.</p>
<p>The significance of scales <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D"> for pod length further supports the involvement of dominance × dominance and additive × additive interactions in this trait. Significant additive (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?d">) and dominance (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?h">) effects for pod length were also reported by <span class="citation" data-cites="rashwan2010estimation">Rashwan (2010)</span> and Thakare et al.&nbsp;(2013).</p>
<p>Among epistatic interactions, dominance × dominance (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?l">), additive × additive (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i">), and additive × dominance (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j">) were observed in different crosses. In the case of pod weight, both dominance effects and additive × additive interactions were significant but acted in a negative direction. However, the positive significance of dominance × dominance interactions suggests that hybridization followed by selection would be an effective strategy for improving this trait.</p>
<p>All three types of digenic interactions (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?l">) were observed for pods per plant. While additive × dominance (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j">) was positive and significant, both dominance (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?h">) and additive × additive (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i">) effects acted in the negative direction. The presence of non-allelic interactions for this trait aligns with the findings of <span class="citation" data-cites="thakare2016genetic">Thakare et al. (2016)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="edematie2021inheritance">Edematie et al. (2021)</span>. Significant positive dominance (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?h">) and dominance × dominance (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?l">) interactions suggest the presence of complementary epistasis. In contrast, the negative significance of dominance × dominance (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?l">) for pod yield per plant implies limited potential for improvement through heterosis breeding for this trait.</p>
<p>The direction of dominance and dominance × dominance interactions indicated duplicate gene action in the expression of traits such as pod weight, pod breadth, pods per cluster, seeds per pod, root weight per plant, and days to first harvest. Dominance was found to play a role in all traits, especially pod length, as reported by <span class="citation" data-cites="santos2024genetic">Santos et al. (2024)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="pallavi2019generation">Pallavi, Singh, and Chaudhary (2019)</span>.</p>
<p>Both additive × additive and dominance × dominance interactions were significant for root weight per plant, while the insignificance of all four scale tests (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D">) for traits like pod breadth, pods per cluster, seeds per pod, days to first harvest, primary branches per plant, and 100-seed weight indicates the adequacy of the additive-dominance model for these traits, and the absence of epistasis. Nonetheless, duplicate epistasis for most yield-related traits in cowpea was previously reported by <span class="citation" data-cites="shinde2021generation">Shinde et al. (2021)</span>.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The generation mean analysis conducted on three cowpea crosses revealed complex genetic control for several important agronomic traits. While the mean effect was highly significant for all key traits, indicating their quantitative nature, the inadequacy of the simple additive-dominance model—evidenced by significant scale tests and the presence of epistasis—highlights the role of non-allelic gene interactions in trait inheritance. Additive × additive, additive × dominance, and dominance × dominance interactions were frequently observed across traits such as pod length, pod yield per plant, pods per plant, and root weight. The predominance of duplicate and complementary epistasis suggests that hybridization followed by selection in segregating generations would be an effective breeding strategy for improving these traits.</p>
<p>Traits like pod breadth, seeds per pod, and 100-seed weight showed no significant epistasis, indicating that selection based on the additive-dominance model may suffice for their improvement. Conversely, traits influenced by significant non-additive gene actions, such as pod yield and pod weight, may benefit more from recombination breeding approaches. Overall, this study underscores the importance of understanding the underlying gene action for designing appropriate breeding strategies. The insights gained provide a valuable foundation for improving yield and related traits in cowpea through targeted hybridization and selection efforts.</p>

<p>Statistical analysis serves as the backbone of scientific research, especially in disciplines like agriculture, where field experiments, survey data, and observational studies generate complex datasets. Despite the increasing emphasis on data-driven decision-making in agricultural research, many students, early-career researchers, and practitioners find themselves at a disadvantage when it comes to performing rigorous statistical analyses. The process is often hindered by a combination of factors: the steep learning curve associated with programming languages such as R and Python, the fragmented nature of statistical learning resources, and the lack of user-friendly tools tailored to agricultural research contexts.</p>
<p>While R and Python are powerful, flexible, and widely adopted in academic and professional settings, their command-line interfaces and syntax-heavy operations can be challenging for those without formal training in statistics or computer programming. Beginners frequently struggle with package selection, data cleaning, model specification, and interpretation of results. Furthermore, existing statistical software either lacks the flexibility and transparency of open-source tools or comes with licensing restrictions and high costs that limit accessibility in resource-constrained settings, particularly in developing countries.</p>
<p>In addition, agricultural research involves domain-specific needs such as handling experimental designs (e.g., CRD, RBD, split-plot), analyzing agronomic trials, processing survey data with appropriate sampling designs, and interpreting interactions between multiple environmental and genetic factors. Traditional statistical packages are not always well-adapted to these specific requirements, leaving researchers to either customize solutions on their own or consult specialists — both of which can delay or compromise the analytical workflow.</p>
<p>To bridge this gap, we developed RAISINS (R and AI Solutions for INferential Statistics) — a web-based platform designed to simplify and democratize statistical analysis for agricultural research. RAISINS integrates the power of R, Python, and AI-driven assistance within an intuitive interface that eliminates the need for code-based interaction. By abstracting complex syntax and offering guided, step-by-step workflows for data upload, analysis, visualization, and interpretation, the platform empowers users to focus on scientific inquiry rather than technical execution.</p>
<p>Built on open-source technologies and scalable cloud infrastructure, RAISINS provides modules for commonly used statistical methods — including descriptive analysis, hypothesis testing, regression models, design of experiments, multi environmental trials, and more — while incorporating AI tools that assist in data summarization, analytical suggestions, and natural language explanations of results. This makes it an ideal solution for students, researchers, extension personnel, and educators engaged in agricultural and allied sciences. RAISINS can be accessed online through its official web portal at https://www.raisins.live/.</p>
<p>In this paper, we present the design, features, and use-cases of RAISINS, and demonstrate how it addresses the unique challenges faced in agricultural data analysis by offering an accessible, robust, and intelligent statistical platform.</p>
