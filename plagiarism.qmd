## Plagiarism Policy {.unnumbered}  

At *JOSTA*, we maintain the highest standards of academic integrity. All submissions undergo rigorous scrutiny to ensure originality and proper scholarly conduct.

### Screening for plagiarism {.unnumbered}  

To safeguard against unethical practices, every manuscript submitted to JOSTA is screened using *Turnitin* plagiarism detection software. This process checks for textual similarities and potential overlaps with previously published material, including journal articles, theses, conference papers, web content, and other sources.

### Acceptable use of language tools {.unnumbered}  

Authors are *permitted to use AI-based tools and language assistants* (e.g., Grammarly, ChatGPT) for improving grammar, clarity, and language structure, provided the intellectual content, interpretation, and conclusions are solely those of the authors.

However, authors must *not use AI or generative tools* to develop:
- Core theoretical frameworks
- Research hypotheses or models
- Methodological structures
- Results or interpretations

Any content derived using such tools must be *explicitly disclosed* and will be subject to editorial scrutiny. JOSTA discourages and may reject work where foundational ideas or analyses are generated by AI.

### Definition of plagiarism {.unnumbered}  

Plagiarism includes, but is not limited to:
- Direct copying of text, data, images, or figures without proper citation
- Paraphrasing substantial portions of another's work without acknowledgment
- Submitting previously published work (self-plagiarism) without disclosure
- Improper use of generative AI for academic content creation  

JOSTA adheres to international norms such as the *COPE (Committee on Publication Ethics) guidelines* and the *UGC (University Grants Commission) regulations on academic integrity* in defining, identifying, and dealing with plagiarism. These frameworks guide our editorial decisions and ensure ethical standards are maintained throughout the publication process.


### Editorial action on plagiarism {.unnumbered}  

If plagiarism is detected at any stage:
- **Before publication:** The manuscript will be rejected, and the authors may be barred from future submission for a defined period.
- **After publication:** The article may be retracted, and a formal notice will be issued to the authorsâ€™ affiliated institutions.

All authors are responsible for the integrity of their submissions. By submitting a manuscript, authors affirm that the content is original and has not been submitted elsewhere.

### Author Responsibility {.unnumbered}  

Authors are advised to:
- Use appropriate citation practices
- Maintain a record of all source materials
- Conduct originality checks before submission

We encourage authors to retain transparency and academic honesty in all stages of research and writing.
