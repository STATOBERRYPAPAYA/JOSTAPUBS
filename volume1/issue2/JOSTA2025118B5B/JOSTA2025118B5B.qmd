## Introduction

In recent decades, livelihood security had emerged as a critical focus area in development studies, emphasizing the need to ensure sustainable living conditions for both present and future generations. The concept of Sustainable Livelihood Security (SLS) represents a holistic approach that integrates current challenges and policy priorities in sustainable development [@Singh2010] and has been increasingly applied in policy analysis frameworks to connect poverty reduction with resilience strategies [@Pani2022]. SLS builds on the three pillars of sustainability: environmental preservation, economic growth, and social equity. It focuses on the interconnections necessary to achieve sustainable results [@Morse2013]. Livelihood security, as first conceptualized by Chambers and Conway, integrates capabilities, equity, and sustainability [@Chambers1992]. Livelihoods refer to the means of earning a living, influenced by factors such as birth, inheritance, and social roles, as well as broader social, economic, and environmental conditions. Equity ensures fair access to resources, while sustainability focuses on preserving these resources for future generations. Recent research also stresses the role of livelihood diversification, adaptive capacity, and social networks in reducing vulnerability to risks [@BeltranTolosa2022; @Barnes2025].

In rural contexts, livelihoods often encompass a mix of on-farm and off-farm activities that help households secure food and income. However, various internal and external factors such as limited income, inadequate mobility strategies, and resource constraints frequently disrupt livelihood security, particularly for livestock-dependent households [@Martin2016]. Key determinants of rural livelihood security include age, farming experience, social participation, income levels, and livestock ownership. To address these challenges, interventions such as farm diversification, the adoption of Good Agricultural Practices (GAP), and empowering rural women to engage in value-addition activities had been suggested [@Mishra2023]. Moreover, livelihoods depend on the availability of household resources and their integration into legal, political, and social systems [@Narayani2011].

Global crises such as climate change, armed conflicts, displacement, pandemics, and digital inequality further exacerbate the challenges to livelihood security, particularly in vulnerable regions. These crises not only hinder progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) but also deepen food and nutrition insecurity for millions worldwide [@UNDP2022]. Addressing this issue requires innovative strategies to enhance food and nutrition security, particularly for smallholder farmers in developing countries. Studies highlighted the importance of prioritizing off-farm and non-farm livelihood diversification rather than attempting all options simultaneously [@Haile2024]. Additionally, traditional farming systems like home gardens, which depend on household assets, play a crucial role in ensuring food security and conserving biodiversity [@George2024]. However, rural areas, particularly in India, continue to face a mix of sustainable and unsustainable farming practices, impacting productivity and resilience [@Abed2025].

In recent years, livelihood security has attracted growing scholarly and policy attention due to challenges such as climate change, globalization, and persistent socio-economic inequalities. To understand the evolving dynamics of livelihood security, bibliometric analysis serves as a powerful tool. Recognized as a scientific discipline, bibliometric analysis systematically evaluates research trends, patterns, and knowledge gaps in specific domains [@Ellegaard2015]. By analyzing scholarly outputs, citation networks, and thematic clusters, bibliometric studies offer critical insights into the evolution of research fields, key contributors, and policy implications. With user-friendly, menu-driven tools for assessing research performance and tracking institutional progress, bibliometric methods have become reliable and informative instruments [@Kumar2023; @Donthu2021]. This study aims to conduct a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of livelihood security, identifying core themes, emerging trends, and existing research gaps. Leveraging advanced bibliometric tools, this paper seeks to provide a roadmap for academics, policymakers, and practitioners striving to enhance livelihood security across diverse contexts. This study utilizes the scopus database to analyze and summarize publications related to livelihood security.

### Data extraction

Scopus was chosen as the primary data source for its vast coverage of peer-reviewed content. It includes over 76 million records from 39,100+ journals 120,000 conferences and 206,000 books. The breadth of this coverage ensures that both established research and emerging themes are captured. Scopus ensures high-quality and reliable publications through curation by the Content Selection and Advisory Board (CSAB). The advanced citation linking in scopus provides 99.9% precision and 98.3% recall for assessing research impact. Scopus also creates detailed author and institutional profiles to highlight key contributors. The present research study was selected between 2014 to 2024 span of time. A total of 6867 articles were published in the field of livelihood security in scopus indexes and out of this the search was conducted on January 25, 2025, using “livelihood security” as the keyword. A total of 514 research articles were published in this period within the subject area of economics, econometrics and finance. 

### Bibliometric methodology

Bibliometric analysis employs quantitative techniques to explore connections within a vast body of scientific literature [@Karantali2024]. Among bibliometric tools, VOSviewer is widely recognized for its effectiveness in data visualization and mapping [@Das2021; @Ye2018; @Oyewola2022; @Gao2021]. Additionally, Biblioshiny, an R-based software tool, enables the identification of influential authors, major affiliations, leading countries, and frequently occurring keywords by generating network visualization graphs [@Thakuria2024; @Thangavel2023; @Rusydiana2021; @Srisusilawati2021]. A combination of VOSviewer, Biblioshiny, and MS Excel was used for data analysis. VOSviewer was utilized for visualizing bibliographic coupling among countries and analyzing keyword distribution. Biblioshiny was employed to examine annual publication trends, citation patterns, key journals, influential authors in livelihood security research, institutional contributors, leading countries, word cloud, and tree map visualizations.

### General overview

The study focuses on publications from 2014 to 2024, revealing an annual growth rate of 11.99% in research on livelihood security. A total of 1,858 authors contributed, with 67 single-authored documents and an average of 3.86 co-authors per document. International collaborations account for 39.3% of the publications. The dataset includes 1,701 unique author keywords, 27,835 references, and an average of 18.6 citations per document.

Among the 514 articles on livelihood security retrieved from the Scopus database, the annual publication trend is presented in @fig-figure1. A clear upward trajectory in research output is visible from 2014 to 2024. In 2014, 29 articles were published, followed by a slight decline in 2015 (18 articles). However, from 2016 onward, the field experienced steady growth, with significant milestones in 2021 (72 articles) and 2023 (74 articles). The year 2024 recorded the highest number of publications (90 articles), marking the peak of scholarly attention during the study period. This trend highlights the growing awareness and academic emphasis on livelihood-related studies over the years.

![Annual publication trend from 2014 to 2024](figures/fig1.png){#fig-figure1 width="384"}

The annual citation pattern of livelihood security publications from 2014 to 2024 is shown in @fig-figure2. The trend indicates considerable fluctuations during the period. In the early years (2014–2015), the average citation rate was in between 4 and 5 citations per article. From 2016 to 2020, the average remained steady in between 2 and 3 citations, reflecting moderate academic attention. A sharp increase was observed in 2021, when the citation rate exceeded 6 citations per article, representing the peak of scholarly influence. This surge suggests that research published around this period received strong recognition, possibly linked to heightened global debates on livelihood resilience, food security, and climate change during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, after 2021, the trend declined steeply, falling to in between 1 and 2 citations in 2022 and dropping close to 1 citation per article by 2024. A probable reason for this may be that newly published articles require time to accumulate citations. Since publications increased significantly during 2022–2024, most of these recent papers have not yet had sufficient time to be cited. Citations generally peak 2–4 years after publication, so the observed decline reflects a natural citation lag rather than reduced academic relevance.

## Limitations of the study

This study is primarily limited to publications indexed in the Scopus database, specifically within the fields of economics, finance, and econometrics, thereby excluding other databases such as Web of Science or various regional repositories. Additionally, the focus on English-language articles means that valuable research published in other languages may be omitted. Moreover, the selected timeframe of 2014–2024 restricts the analysis, potentially overlooking earlier foundational work as well as very recent emerging trends. Furthermore, only articles have been considered as the document type for this analysis, excluding other forms of scholarly publications such as reviews, conference papers, or book chapters.

## Conclusion

The analysis showed that livelihood security research expanded steadily over the past decade, with publications rising sharply after 2016 and peaking in 2024, although citation rates fluctuated and reached their highest point in 2021 before declining in subsequent years. Marine Policy, Environment, Development and Sustainability, and World Development emerged as the leading journals, while authors such as Belton B, Balasubramanya S, and Bennett N J were among the most prolific contributors. Key institutions, including Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, the University for Development Studies, and Michigan State University, played major roles in shaping the research landscape. The USA recorded the highest number of citations, followed by India and Canada, indicating strong contributions from multiple regions. Collaboration networks further revealed the USA as a major global hub with strong links to India, Germany, and Australia, while India and China also demonstrated extensive international partnerships. Keyword analysis identified “food security,” “livelihood,” “climate change,” and “sustainability” as dominant themes, along with related concepts such as rural development, gender, adaptive management, fisheries, and smallholder farming, reflecting the interdisciplinary and global nature of livelihood security research. Overall, the bibliometric analysis of 514 Scopus-indexed articles published between 2014 and 2024 highlighted emerging research fronts and provided valuable insights for scholars and policymakers, emphasizing the need for strengthened international collaboration, targeted interventions, and sustainable practices to enhance livelihood resilience and support sustainable development.
